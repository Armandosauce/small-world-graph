'''Alliance '90/The Greens''' ([[German language|German]]: '''Bündnis 90/Die Grünen''') is a political party in [[Germany]]. It was formed in [[1992]] by the Western German party ''Die Grünen'' and the Eastern German ''Bündnis '90''. Its main interests are [[ecology]], [[civil rights]], equality between men and women and the chances of [[immigrant]]s in the German society. Their motto was ''ecologically, basic democratic, social, without violence''.

==History==
=== Early years ===
In the [[1970s]], there were a lot of [[protest]]s against [[nuclear power]] in Germany. The protesters had no support in the political parties in Germany. So they got the idea to found their own party.

In the [[election]] to the [[European Parliament]] of [[1979]], their party, the '''Sonstige Politische Vereinigung Die Grünen''', got 3,2 %. They tried again and this time it was accepted and was founded in [[Karlsruhe]] on [[January 13]]th, [[1980]].

Since their aims were for civil rights and ecology, a lot of former Anti [[Vietnam War]] protesters joined the party.
The Greens were [[pacifism|pacifists]] and strictly against nuclear weapons. They wanted to reach a de-militarized Europe.

=== Leaders ===
First chiefs of the party were [[Herbert Gruhl]] and [[Petra Kelly]]. After a short while some right-winged people left the party, so they became a left-winged party.

=== Incluence ===
In the old [[GDR]], a Green party was founded in [[1989]] and joined to the Western Greens in [[1990]]. In [[1993]] the Bündnis 90 - a civil rights movement from the former GDR - and Die Grünen joined them.

In [[1998]] they joined the federal government under [[Gerhard Schröder]] together with the Social democrats.

==== Problems ====
The Green lost a lot of their values in that time. They voted for joining the Kosovo War and to attack Serbia in [[1999]] and lost their social issues. In [[2005]] they lost their power in the federal government.
Currently they are in opposition in the federal and all state parliaments.

==Programme==
The Greens are interested in ecology, so one of their main issues is saving the earth - especially the climate - without using nuclear power.

The second main issue of the Greens is gender mainstraming.

The third issue are the integration and the chances of immigrants in Germany.

In the foreign policy the Green changed their position in their first period in federal government. Before that time they wanted German soldiers only to allow peace keeping missions of the United Nations, many Greens wanted a de-militarized Germany. After their legislative period - with main influence of foreign secretary Fischer - they accepted to join international military missions e.g. in Afganisthan. But their main issue is to avoid conflicts by developement policy and international cooperation. Main issues of foreign policy are international envoirementional and climate saving projects like the Kyoto protocoll, the developement of the European Union and a reform of the international law like the installing of the International Crime Court in The Hague.

They are left-winged liberals.

==Prominent Green politcians==

* [[Joschka Fischer]], former foreign secretary and vice chancellor of Germany
* [[Petra Kelly]], pazifist, first chairman of the Greens
* [[Jürgen Trittin]], former enviromential secretary of Germany
* [[Otto Schily]], later SPD and home secretary of Germany
* [[Renate Künast]], former secretary for agriculture of Germany
* [[Hans-Christian Ströbele]], lawyer and former chairman of the Greens, only sucessful direct candidate of the Greens in the [[Bundestag]]
