'''Chelsea Victoria Clinton''' (born February 27, 1980) is the daughter and only child of former [[Arkansas Governor]] and [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] and former [[United States Senator]] and current [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]].

==Early years==

Chelsea Clinton was born in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].  Her name was inspired by her parents' fondness for [[Judy Collins]]' 1969 recording of the [[Joni Mitchell]] song &quot;[[Chelsea Morning]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DD1E3BF93AA25752C0A965958260 | title= THE INAUGURATION; Shedding Light On a Morning And a Name | publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=1993-01-19 | accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chelsea was described as a precocious child, for example: as a toddler, a family friend reports, instead of saying, &quot;I have to get a shot&quot;, she would say, &quot;I have to get my immunizations.&quot;&lt;ref name=hello&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/chelseaclinton/ | title=Chelsea Clinton | publisher=''hellomagazine.com'' | accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in elementary school, Chelsea skipped the third grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/chicago/players/chelsea/index.shtml/ | title= Chelsea Clinton Bio | publisher=''CNN'' | accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents encouraged her academic excellence, with Bill keeping a miniature desk for his daughter in the governor's office when he was Governor of [[Arkansas]].

In Little Rock, Clinton attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and [[Mann Arts and Science Magnet Middle School|Horace Mann Junior High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hillary-rodham-clinton.org/chelsea_clinton.html | title=Chelsea Clinton|publisher=hillary-rodham-clinton.org |accessdate=2007-12-13}} ''NB:  This site is not associated with Hillary Clinton.  According to the website, &quot;We provide information on the life of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton including family information, educational information and information about her as a US Senator.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her childhood, she enjoyed volleyball, cards, ping pong and movies.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN Bio&quot; /&gt; Chelsea became a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.famousveggie.com/quotes.cfm | title=Quotes by Famous Vegetarians | publisher=''FamousVeggie.com'' | accessdate=2008-04-16}} Chelsea Clinton: &quot;I'm a big health-food freak and a vegetarian devotee.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; when she was 11 years old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Quirks/2008/01/06/chelsea_clinton_a_rebel_vegetarian/9638/ | title=Chelsea Clinton a rebel … vegetarian | publisher=''United Press International'' | date=2008-01-06 | accessdate=2008-04-16}} Chelsea Clinton: &quot;...

==Teenager at the White House==
[[Image:Clinton family.jpg|thumb|left|upright|White House portrait of the Clinton family]]
Clinton moved into the [[White House]] on the day of her father's first inauguration on January 20, 1993, when she was twelve years old. Chelsea's Secret Service [[cryptonym]] was Energy.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, K. ''Air Force One: A History of the Presidents and Their Planes''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Washington, D.C.]], she attended [[Sidwell Friends School]]. She was a [[National Merit Scholar]]ship finalist in 1997.  Having taken dance classes since she was four years old, Clinton began taking [[ballet]] courses at the Washington School of Ballet in 1993. She played the role of the Favorite Aunt in the [[Washington Ballet]]'s 1996 production of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Nutcracker]]''. Clinton is also a veteran of the [[Model United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/munda/munmore.htm | title=MUNDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On February 5, 1999, just before the Senate vote on [[impeachment]], ''[[People Magazine|People]]'' ran a cover story on Chelsea Clinton. The cover story irked the [[First Family]], as well as the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;coverstory&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =King | first=John  | title =Secret Service concerned over Chelsea Clinton cover story | publisher =[[CNN]] | date =1999-02-05 | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/05/chelsea.clinton.01/| accessdate = 2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
She assumed some of her mother's White House hostess responsibilities when Hillary Clinton was running for the Senate in 2000,&lt;ref name=&quot;hostess&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/09/07/chelseaclinton.ap/index.html | title=More visible than ever, Clinton's daughter stands in for first lady | publisher=Associated Press | date=2000-09-07 | accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; continuing until the end of her father's presidency on January 20, 2001.

==Life after the Clinton presidency==

Chelsea is currently studying Health Policy and Management at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Mailman School of Public Health]]. At [[Stanford University]], where Chelsea did her undergraduate studies, she had declared a major in [[chemistry]] with an interest in medicine before switching to history after two years.&lt;ref name=NYT073007&gt;{{cite news | author=Jodi Kantor | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/us/politics/31chelsea.html | title=Primed for a Second Stint as First Daughter | publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=2007-07-30 | accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 film ''[[Chasing Liberty]]'' was said to be inspired by a photograph of Clinton at a Stanford basketball game, trying to blend in with other students.&lt;ref name=&quot;justask&quot;&gt;{{cite news   | last =Nevius| first=C.W.  | title =Just ask Chelsea, Jenna and Barbara  | pages =E1 | publisher =[[San Francisco Chronicle|SF Chronicle]] | date =2004-01-22  | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/01/22/DDGJO4EJ9U1.DTL | accessdate = 2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, she graduated from Stanford; her undergraduate [[thesis]] topic was the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement]] in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Purdum&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/17/national/17CHEL.html?ex=1205125200&amp;en=c1272733823406ca&amp;ei=5070 | title=Chelsea Clinton, Still a Closed Book | author=Todd S. Purdum | publisher=''New York Times'' | date=2001-06-17 | accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to earn a [[Master's degree]] at [[University College, Oxford]], in [[international relations]].&lt;ref name=NYT073007 /&gt;

In 2003, Clinton joined the consulting firm [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] in [[New York City]]; she was the youngest person hired in her class, hired alongside those holding [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;sixfigurejob&quot;&gt;{{cite news   | title =Chelsea Clinton lands six-figure job| publisher =[[CNN]]| date =2003-03-09 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Northeast/03/08/chelsea.clinton.ap/ | accessdate = 2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT073007/&gt;
In the fall of 2006, she left McKinsey and went to work for [[Avenue Capital Group]], a [[hedge fund]] run by Marc Lasry, a donor to Democratic causes and supporter of the Clintons.  She serves on the board of the [[School of American Ballet]]. She has also served as co-chairperson of a fund-raising week and for her father’s [[Clinton Foundation]].&lt;ref name=NYT073007/&gt;

[[Image:ChelseaclintonCampaign.jpg|thumb|left|Chelsea Clinton speaking to students on behalf of her mother's campaign at the [[University of Missouri]], January 2008.]]
In 2005, Clinton took up residence in the [[Gramercy, Manhattan|Gramercy neighborhood]], on the East side of [[Manhattan]]. During the [[United States general elections, 2006|November 2006 mid-term election]], in which her mother was running for re-election to the Senate, attention was drawn to her residence when it was discovered that an error at her 20th Street polling station had resulted in her name not being in the voting book.  Clinton was allowed to vote via a paper ballot.&lt;ref name=&quot;votingbook&quot;&gt;{{cite news   | last =Barron | first =James | coauthors =and Charkes, Julie Steadman | title =Mother's on ballot, but daughter's not in voting book | publisher =[[The New York Times]]| date =2006-11-08 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/nyregion/08chelsea.html | accessdate = 2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chelsea has reportedly been romantically linked to actor [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] and journalist/author [[Ian Klaus]].  Chelsea is currently dating [[Marc Mezvinsky]].  Marc is the son of former [[Iowa]] congressman and convicted felon [[Edward Mezvinsky]] and former [[Pennsylvania]] congresswoman [[Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky]].

===Campaigning for her mother===
[[Image:Chelsea feb08 calpoly.jpg|thumb|upright|Chelsea Clinton speaking during a campaign stop at [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly]] for her mother, February 2008]]

Until Hillary Clinton began her presidential campaign, Chelsea had never publicly commented about any of her parents' policies or public statements.  But she did begin to rally support for her mother and speak publicly on her behalf. In May 2006, Hillary publicly apologized to her daughter for critical remarks she made about young people's [[work ethic]], after Chelsea privately took exception to her mother's comments.&lt;ref name=&quot;senclintonapology&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Sen. Clinton Apologizes To Chelsea |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/15/politics/main1618081.shtml |publisher=[[Associated Press|AP]]  |date=2006-05-15 |accessdate=2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, she began to campaign for her mother's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Iowa]] before the January [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008|caucuses]], greeting potential voters in [[Des Moines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea Clinton Guards Her Words |date=2007-12-31 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2008-01-01 |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/12/31/chelsea-clinton-guards-her-words/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, she campaigned for her mother extensively across the country, largely on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/01/13/MNDDUEOT1.DTL |title=Chelsea Clinton steps into California spotlight to rally for mother |first=Carla |last=Marinucci |authorlink=Carla Marinucci |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.arkansasonline.com/news/2008/jan/26/chelsea-clinton-visit-asu/ |title=Chelsea Clinton to visit ASU |publisher=Associated Press |date=2008-01-26 |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2008/03/06/News/Chelsea.Clinton.Visits.Campus-3255099.shtml | title=Chelsea Clinton visits campus | author=Emily Schultheis | publisher=''Daily Pennsylvanian'' | date=2008-03-06 | accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By early April 2008 she had spoken at 100 college campuses on behalf of her mother's candidacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;chelseavoice&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/09/AR2008040903945.html?sid%3DST2008040904087&amp;sub=AR  |title=Chelsea Clinton Finds Her Voice: Daughter Evolves From Quiet Supporter to Self-Assured Campaigner | author=Anne E. Kornblut | work=The Washington Post | page=A01 |date=2008-04-10 | accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign, [[Philippe Reines]], Hillary's [[press secretary]], often shadowed Chelsea during her public appearances, attempting to deflect &quot;...hangers-on, swooning frat boys and, mostly, looming trouble in the form of microphones, cameras and notepads&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;topdog&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Clinton hand shields Chelsea |author=Parnes, Amie |publisher=Politico.com |date=2008-04-16 |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0408/9641.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chelsea's blanket refusal to speak to any media members has been noted. In December 2007, she refused to answer a question from a 9-year-old “kid reporter” named Sydney Rieckhoff from [[Scholastic News Kids Press Corps|Scholastic News]] who asked whether she thought her father would be a good “first man.”&lt;ref name=FOX /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/15/chelsea.clinton/index.html CNN News: February 16, 2008-Campaign role ups pressure on Chelsea Clinton to talk to media]&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea replied, “I’m sorry, I don’t talk to the press, and that applies to you, unfortunately — even though I think you’re cute.”&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;&lt;ref name=FOX&gt;[http://elections.foxnews.com/2007/12/30/silent-chelsea-clinton-brushes-off-9-year-old-reporter-on-campaign-trail/ Fox News: December 30, 2007-Silent Chelsea Clinton Brushes Off 9-Year-Old Reporter on Campaign Trail]&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy arose when MSNBC’s [[David Shuster]] said that Chelsea was being “pimped out” by her parents for the campaign. Shuster was later suspended for his remarks.&lt;ref name=&quot;topdog&quot;/&gt; Chelsea introduced her mother on August 26 at the [[2008 Democratic Convention]].
