&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE OBAMA'S NAME --&gt;'''Barack Hussein Obama II''' ({{pron-en|bəˈrɑːk huːˈseɪn oʊˈbɑːmə}}; born August 4, 1961) is the [[List of Presidents of the United States|44th]] and current [[President of the United States]].  He is the first [[African American]] to hold the office.  Obama was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Illinois]] from January 2005 until November 2008, when he resigned following his [[United States presidential election, 2008|election]] to the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|presidency]].

Obama is a graduate of [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia University]] and [[Harvard Law School]], where he was the [[List of African-American firsts|first African American]] president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. He worked as a [[Community organizing|community organizer]] in [[Chicago]] prior to earning his law degree, and practiced as a [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] attorney in Chicago before serving three terms in the [[Illinois Senate]] from 1997 to 2004. He also taught [[constitutional law]] at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] from 1992 to 2004.

Following an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 2000, Obama was elected to the United States Senate in November 2004. Obama delivered the [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|keynote address]] at the [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in July 2004. During his tenure as Senator, he served on several committees, including the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations]], [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Environment and Public Works]],  [[United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs|Veterans' Affairs]], [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Health, Education, Labor and Pensions]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]].

After a particularly close [[Barack Obama presidential primary campaign, 2008|campaign]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic Party presidential primary]] against rival [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], he won his party's nomination as a candidate for president, becoming the first major African American candidate for president.  In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 general election]], he defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[John McCain]] and was [[Inauguration of Barack Obama|sworn in]] as president on January 20, 2009.

After her divorce, Dunham married [[Indonesia]]n student [[Lolo Soetoro]], who was attending college in Hawaii.

He then returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, [[Madelyn Dunham|Madelyn]] and [[Stanley Armour Dunham]], while attending [[Punahou School]] from the [[Education in the United States#School grades|fifth grade]] in 1971 until his graduation from high school in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Serafin|title=Punahou Grad Stirs Up Illinois Politics|date=March 21, 2004|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/03/21/news/story4.html|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|accessdate=April 13, 2008}} See also: Obama (1995, 2004), Chapters 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his early childhood, Obama recalled, &quot;That my father looked nothing like the people around me — that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk — barely registered in my mind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Obama (1995), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his [[multiracial]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Obama (1995), Chapters 4 and 5.

Some of his fellow students at Punahou School later told the ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' that Obama was mature for his age, and that he sometimes attended college parties and other events in order to associate with African American students and military service people. Reflecting later on his formative years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: &quot;The opportunity that Hawaii offered — to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect — became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=B.
