'''Catherine Howard''' (born probably 1521;&lt;ref name = tudorhist&gt;{{cite web|url = http://englishhistory.net/tudor/monarchs/howard.html|title = Catherine Howard|publisher = englishhistory.net|work = Tudor England|accesdate = 2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; somewhere between 1520 - 1525 - died 13 February 13 1542) was the fifth wife of [[Henry VIII of England]].
==Childhood==
Catherine Howard (also spelled Katherine) was the tenth child of Lord Edmund Howard and Joyce Culpepper. Her father was the second son of the [[duke]] of Norfolk. She was a cousin to [[Anne Boleyn]], the second wife of Henry VIII.&lt;ref name = tudorhist/&gt;

Catherine's family was poor so they sent Catherine to live with her step-grandmother, Agnes Tilney.&lt;ref name = tudorhist/&gt; Agnes Tilney, the Duchess of Norfolk, had a large household, but it wasn't very strict. Catherine could read and write, but she was the least educated of Henry VIII's wives. 

Catherine was taught music by Henry Manox when she was fifteen years old.  He possibly [[:en:wikt:seduce|seduced]] her.  She [[:wikt:deny|denied]] this. Catherine did however fall in love with and have an affair with a gentleman at her grandmother's court called Francis Dereham.&lt;ref name = tudorhist/&gt;

==Arrival at court==
Catherine became a lady-in-waiting to the queen in 1539 or 1540, she was probably about eighteen years old.&lt;ref name = tudorhist/&gt; 

The queen then was the fourth wife of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  The king disliked his wife, [[Anne of Cleves]], for many reasons. Some of these reasons were &quot;bad breath&quot;, her appearance, and bad smell. 

Henry fell in love with Catherine, now probably nineteen but maybe only fifteen years old. Many historians believe that he married her because she was young and healthy, and he wanted a son for an heir. He most likely believed that Catherine could give him a son because she was young and healthy. 

In July 1540, Henry and Catherine got married at Oatlands Palace in [[Surrey]].

==Marriage==
[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] adored his young bride and showered her with gifts. Despite of this, Catherine was very unhappy because her husband was severely overweight (he was about 300 pounds at the time) and had stinking ulcers on his legs. So, she picked up a lover who was her cousin, Thomas Culpepper. Thomas Culpepper was very handsome, but he had a bad reputation. He supposedly had raped a woman and killed her husband. But Catherine didn't care. She was head over heels in love with him.

==Downfall==
Rumors then swirled that Catherine was unfaithful, but it wasn't until Francis Dereham said that he and Catherine had intimate relationships with each other that it was followed up. Catherine then, in 1541, was arrested and charged with high treason. Henry was very upset and cried. But he made up his mind that Catherine was to be executed like her cousin, [[Anne Boleyn]]. In February of 1542, Catherine was told that she was to die. Terrified to the block, she asked for the block itself and practiced putting her head on it. The next morning, she was pale going to the block, but she was calm. Before she died, she announced, &quot;I die a Queen, but I would rather have died the wife of Culpepper.&quot; Then, the executioner chopped her head off. She was either seventeen or twenty-two. She now lays in [[St. Peter Ad Vincula]].
