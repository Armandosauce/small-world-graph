Clinton left office with an [[approval rating]] at 66%, the highest end of office rating of any president since [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;C)(0&quot;/&gt; Since then, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. Clinton created the [[William J. Clinton Foundation]] to promote and address international causes such as treatment and prevention of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] and [[global warming]].

In 2004, he released his autobiography, ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'', and more recently has been involved in his wife Hillary's [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]] and in that of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]].

== Early life ==
[[Image:William Jefferson Blythe 1950.jpg|thumb|upright|William Jefferson Blythe, III, in 1950 at age four. Known at the time as Billy, he did not formally adopt his stepfather's name until age fourteen.]]
[[Image:Bill Clinton Boyhood Home in Hope, Arkansas IMG 1515.JPG|thumb|Bill Clinton Boyhood Home in [[Hope, Arkansas]]]]

Bill Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III in [[Hope, Arkansas|Hope]], [[Arkansas]]. His father, [[William Jefferson Blythe, Jr.]], was a traveling [[salesman]] who died in an [[automobile]] accident three months before Bill was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse.gov bio&quot; /&gt;  Following his birth, in order to study nursing, his mother [[Virginia Clinton Kelley|Virginia Dell Cassidy]] (1923-1994), traveled to [[New Orleans]], leaving Bill in Hope with grandparents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and operated a small [[grocery store]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot;/&gt; At a time when the [[Southern United States]] were [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]], Bill's grandparents sold goods on [[Credit (finance)|credit]] to people of all racial groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot;/&gt;  In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and shortly thereafter married [[Roger Clinton, Sr.|Roger Clinton]], who together with his brother owned an [[Car dealership|automobile dealership]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Clinton |first=Bill |title=My Life |publisher=[[Random House, Inc]] |year=2004 |isbn=140003003X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.

Although he assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Billy (as he was known then) turned fourteen that he formally adopted the surname Clinton, partially as a gesture toward his stepfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;  Clinton says he remembers his stepfather as a [[gambler]] and an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who regularly abused his mother and, at times, his half-brother, [[Roger Clinton, Jr.|Roger, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Maraniss |first=David |title=First In His Class: A Biography Of Bill Clinton |publisher=Touchstone |year=1996 |isbn= 0684818906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot;/&gt;

== Education ==
In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and [[Hot Springs High School (Arkansas)|Hot Springs High School]] - where he was an active student leader, avid [[reader]], and [[musician]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot;/&gt; He was in the chorus and played the [[tenor saxophone]], winning first chair in the state band's [[saxophone]] section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to [[music]], but as he noted in his [[autobiography]] ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'':

{{cquote|(...) Sometime in my sixteenth year I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official. I loved music and thought I could be very good, but I knew I would never be [[John Coltrane]] or [[Stan Getz]]. I was interested in medicine and thought I could be a fine doctor, but I knew I would never be [[Michael E. DeBakey|Michael DeBakey]]. But I knew I could be great in public service.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;}}

[[Image:Clinton at Georgetown 1967.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington D.C.]], receiving a degree in 1968, during which he ran for [[President]] of the Student Council.]]
In 1963, two influential moments in Clinton's life contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit to the [[White House]] to meet President [[John F. Kennedy]], as a [[Boys Nation]] senator.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; The other was listening to [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King's]] 1963 ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech (he memorized Dr. King's words).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=It All Began in a Place Called Hope (Archived whitehouse.gov Article) |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]], previously [[The White House]] |url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html |accessdate=2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], receiving a [[List of tagged degrees|Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service]] ([[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]][[Diplomatic service|F.S.]]) degree in 1968. He spent the summer of 1967, the summer before his senior year, working as an [[intern]] for Arkansas [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; While in college he became a brother of [[Alpha Phi Omega]] and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. Clinton was also a member of Youth Order of [[DeMolay International|DeMolay]], but he never actually became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].&lt;ref&gt; Political Base. &quot;Bill Clinton.&quot; http://www.politicalbase.com/people/bill-clinton/13418/ (accessed November 10, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of [[Kappa Kappa Psi]]'s National Honorary Band Fraternity, Inc.&lt;ref&gt; Kappa Kappa PSI &quot;Prominent Members&quot; http://www.kkpsi.org/prominentmembers.asp (accessed November 10, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduation he won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[University College, Oxford]] where he studied [[Government]] (the Oxford course known as '[[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]]').&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; He developed an interest in [[rugby union]], playing at Oxford and later for the Little Rock Rugby club in Arkansas. While at Oxford he also participated in [[Vietnam War]] [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|protests]], including organizing an October 1969 [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] event.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; In later life he admitted to smoking [[cannabis]] at the university, but claimed that he &quot;never inhaled&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;

After Oxford, Clinton attended [[Yale Law School]] and obtained a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) degree in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; While at Yale, he began dating law student Hillary Rodham who was a year ahead of him. They married in 1975 and their only child, [[Chelsea Clinton|Chelsea]], was born in 1980.

==Early political career==
===Leader of McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign in Texas===
During Yale, Clinton took a job with the [[George McGovern|McGovern]] campaign and was assigned to lead McGovern's effort in Texas.  He spent considerable time in Dallas, Texas, at the McGovern campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue where he had an office. There, Clinton worked with [[Ron Kirk]], who was later elected mayor of Dallas twice, future governor of Texas [[Ann Richards]], and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) [[Steven Spielberg]].

===Governor of Arkansas===
After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a professor at the [[University of Arkansas]]. A year later, he ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1974. The incumbent, [[John Paul Hammerschmidt]], defeated Clinton by a 52% to 48% margin. Without opposition in the general election, Clinton was elected [[Arkansas]] [[Attorney General]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;
{{see|Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1978}}

[[Image:Bill Clinton 1978.jpg|thumb|left|Clinton, as the newly elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] meeting with President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1978.]]
Clinton was elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] in 1978, making him the youngest governor in the country at age thirty-two. He worked on educational reform and Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of [[Cuba]]n refugees (from the [[Mariel boatlift]]) detained in [[Fort Chaffee]] in 1980. [[Monroe Schwarzlose]] of [[Kingsland, Arkansas|Kingsland]] in [[Cleveland County, Arkansas|Cleveland County]], polled 31% of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat in the general election that year by [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challenger [[Frank D. White]]. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;
{{see|Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1980}}

Clinton joined friend's [[Bruce Lindsey]]'s law firm of [http://www.wlj.com/ Wright, Lindsey and Jennings], though he spent most of the next two years working on his re-election campaign. Clinton was again elected governor and kept his job for ten years. He helped [[Arkansas]] transform its [[economy]] and significantly improve the state's educational system. He became a leading figure among the [[New Democrats]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot;/&gt; The New Democrats, organized within the [[Democratic Leadership Council|Democratic Leadership Council (DLC)]] were a branch of the Democratic Party that called for welfare reform and smaller government, a policy supported by both Democrats and Republicans. He served as Chair of the [[National Governors Association]] from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

Clinton made economic growth, job creation and educational improvement high priorities. For [[senior citizens]], he removed the [[sales tax]] from [[medicine]] and increased the home property tax exemption.

In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee, chaired by Clinton's wife, attorney and [[Legal Services Corporation]] chair [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], succeeded in reforming the education system, transforming it from the worst in the nation, into one of the best. This has been considered by many the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. Clinton and the committee were responsible for state educational improvement programs, notably more spending for schools, rising opportunities for gifted children, an increase in vocational education, raising of teachers' salaries, inclusion of a wider variety of courses, and mandatory teacher testing for aspiring educators.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt; 

The Clinton's personal and business affairs during the 1980s included transactions which became the basis of the [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]] investigation, which dogged his later presidential administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clinton Wars&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Blumenthal |first=Sidney |title=The Clinton Wars |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |edition=1st |year=2003 |isbn= 0374125023}}&lt;/ref&gt; After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Harris |first=John F. |title=The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House |publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks |year=2006 |edition=1st |isbn= 0375760849 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic presidential primaries of 1988===

In 1987 there was media speculation Clinton would enter the race after then-[[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Mario Cuomo]] declined to run and Democratic front-runner [[Gary Hart]] withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored, but ultimately vetoed, by the First Lady).&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot;&gt;David Maraniss, ''First in His Class: A Biography of Bill Clinton'' (New York: Random House, 1996; ISBN 978-0684818900).&lt;/ref&gt; For the nomination, Clinton endorsed [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Michael Dukakis]]. However, he gave the opening night address at the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]], which was nationally televised, but it was criticized for length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Church|first=George J.|title=Cover: Is Bill Clinton For Real?|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,974739,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1992-01-27|accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presenting himself as a moderate and a member of the [[New Democrat]] wing of the Democratic Party, he headed the moderate [[Democratic Leadership Council]] in 1990 and 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=Bob |title=The Choice: How Bill Clinton Won |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |edition= |year=2005 |isbn= 074328514X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic presidential primaries of 1992===

{{see|Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1992}}
Due to his youthful appearance he was often called the &quot;Boy Governor&quot;. In the first contest, the [[Iowa caucus]], he finished a very distant third to Iowa Senator [[Tom Harkin]]. During the campaign for the [[New Hampshire Primary]] reports of an extramarital affair with [[Gennifer Flowers]] surfaced. As Clinton fell far behind former [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Paul Tsongas]] in the New Hampshire polls,&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; following the [[Super Bowl]], Clinton and his wife Hillary went on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' to refute the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the [[New Hampshire Democratic primary, 1992|New Hampshire primary]], but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. On election night, Clinton labeled himself &quot;The Comeback Kid&quot;. He ended leading New Hampshire by a large percentage. However, Tsongas picked up little or no momentum from his victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;{{Clarify me|date=February 2009}}

Winning the big prizes of [[Florida]] and [[Texas]] and many of the [[Southern United States|Southern primaries]] gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former [[California]] Governor [[Jerry Brown]] was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside of his native South.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt;

With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted the New York primary, which contained a large number of delegates. He scored a resounding victory in [[New York City]] and won, shedding his image as a regional candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt; Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in [[Jerry Brown]]'s home state of [[California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

===Presidential election===
[[Image:Debates.jpg|thumb|right|Bill Clinton with [[Ross Perot]], Independent, and President [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Republican party (United States)|Republican]], in a national debate.]]

{{main|United States presidential election, 1992}}
{{see also|Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992}}

Clinton won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] (43.0% of the vote) against Republican incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]] (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire [[Populism|populist]] [[Ross Perot]], who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote) on a platform focusing on domestic issues; a significant part of Clinton's success was Bush's steep decline in public approval. Because Bush's [[United States Presidential approval rating|approval rating]]s were in the 80% range during the [[Gulf War]], he was described as &quot;unbeatable.&quot;  However, when Bush compromised with Democrats in an attempt to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his [[Read my lips: no new taxes|promise not to raise taxes]], hurting his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt; By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to slightly over 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Presidents Stack Up: A look at U.S. presidents' job-approval ratings |publisher=[[Wall Street Journal|The Wall Street Journal Online]] |year=2006 |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-presapp0605-31.html |accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt; Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-[[communism]], but with the end of the [[Cold War]], the party lacked a uniting issue. When [[Pat Buchanan]] and [[Pat Robertson]] addressed Christian themes

His election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the [[White House]], and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse.gov bio&quot;/&gt; It was the first time this had occurred since the [[Jimmy Carter]] presidency in the late 1970s.

However, during the campaign questions of [[conflict of interest]] regarding state business and the politically powerful [[Rose Law Firm]], at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose.  Clinton maintained questions were moot because all transactions with the state were deducted prior to determining Hillary's firm pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ifill |first=Gwen |title=Hillary Clinton Defends Her Conduct in Law Firm |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1D61039F934A25750C0A964958260 |date=1992-03-17 |accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot;/&gt; Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents &quot;for the price of one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacGillis|first=Alec |last2=Kornblut |first2=Anne E. |title=Hillary Clinton Embraces Her Husband's Legacy |publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/21/AR2007122102588.html |page=A1|date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency, 1993&amp;ndash;2001==
{{main|Presidency of Bill Clinton}}

[[Image:Clinton.jpg|thumb|right|Clinton's official White House portrait.]]

===First term, 1993&amp;ndash;1997===
Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd [[President of the United States]] on January 20, 1993. In his inaugural address he declared:

{{cquote|Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/inaug/clinton1.htm|title=Bill Clinton First Address, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Legislative agenda====
Shortly after taking office, Clinton signed the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. While this action was popular, Clinton's attempt to fulfill another campaign promise of allowing openly [[homosexuality|homosexual men and women]] to serve in the armed forces garnered criticism from the left (for being too tentative in promoting [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]]) and from the right (who opposed any effort to allow homosexuals to serve). After much debate, Congress implemented the &quot;[[Don't ask, don't tell]]&quot; policy, stating as long as homosexuals keep their sexuality secret, they may serve in the military. Some gay rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n11_v28/ai_18855826 Stranger Among Friends. - book reviews] - John Cloud, ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaymilitary.ucsb.edu/PressClips/03_0110_WashingtonBladeEd.htm Washington Blade Editorial: Bush Has Mandate to Let Gays Serve] - Kevin Naff, Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military, 2003-01-10&lt;/ref&gt; These advocates feel Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting President [[Harry Truman]] used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argue an executive order might have prompted the Democratic Senate to write the exclusion of homosexuals into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt; Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton said he did not think any serious person could say the way the policy was being implemented was not &quot;out of whack.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/1999/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/11/clinton.gays.military/index.html President seeks better implementation of 'do not ask, do not tell'] - [[CNN]], 1999-12-11 &lt;/ref&gt;

The Clinton administration launched the first official [[White House]] website on October 21, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=http://clinton1.nara.gov/White_House/html/White_House_Home.html |title=Welcome to the White House|work= |publisher= | date|accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa012201b.htm |title=The Clinton White House Web Site|work= |publisher= | date|accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=http://clinton5.nara.gov/index.html|title=Welcome to the White House|work= |publisher= | date|accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa012201b.htm|title=The Clinton White House Web Site: Part 2: Preserving the Clinton White House Web Site|work= |publisher= | date|accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, &quot;Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13011 - Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to fully utilize information technology to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert |last=Longley |url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa012201a.htm|title=The Clinton White House Web Site: Part 1: Perhaps the most important Web site in American history|work= |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1993, Clinton controversially supported ratification of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] by the U.S. Senate. Clinton, along with most of his Democratic Leadership Committee allies, strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong intra-party disagreement. Opposition chiefly came from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of [[Ross Perot]]. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor, 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the President on January 1, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, C. Don, Kenneth A. Wink; &quot;The Passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the U.S. House of Representatives: Presidential Leadership or Presidential Luck?&quot; Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 27, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton signed the [[Brady Bill]] into law on November 30, 1993, which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases. He also expanded the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]], a subsidy for low income workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt;

One of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda was the result of a taskforce headed by [[Hillary Clinton]], which was [[Clinton health care plan|a health care reform plan]] aimed at achieving universal coverage via a national healthcare plan. Though initially well-received in political circles, it was ultimately doomed by well-organized opposition from conservatives, the [[American Medical Association]], and the health insurance industry. However, [[John F. Harris]], a biographer of Clinton's, states the program failed because of a lack of co-ordination within the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; Despite his party holding a majority in Congress, the effort to create a national healthcare system ultimately died under heavy public pressure. It was the first major legislative defeat of Clinton's administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt;
Two months later, after two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress in the [[U.S. House election, 1994|mid-term elections in 1994]], for the first time in forty years.

Clinton signed the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] in August 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for fifteen million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90% of small businesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/080393-presidential-press-conference-in-nevada.htm|title=Presidential Press Conference - 08/03/1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2% of taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clintonpresidentialcenter.org/legacy/012594-speech-by-president-sotu-address.htm|title=1994 State of the Union Address}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, through the implementation of spending restraints, it mandated the budget be balanced over a number of years.

In 1997 Senators [[Ted Kennedy]], a Democrat, and [[Orrin Hatch]], a Republican, teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff and succeeded in passing legislation forming the [[Children's Health Insurance Program]], the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That same year Hillary Clinton shepherded the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] through Congress and two years later Rodham Clinton succeeded in helping pass the [[Foster Care Independence Act]]. Bill Clinton supported both bills as well, and signed both of them into law.

====Travelgate controversy====
{{main|White House travel office controversy|White House FBI files controversy}}

When several longtime employees of the White House Travel Office were fired, the White House travel office controversy began on May 19, 1993. A [[whistleblower]]'s letter, written during the previous administration, triggered an FBI investigation, which revealed evidence of financial malfeasance. Independent Counsel [[Kenneth Starr]] investigated the firings and found no evidence of wrongdoing on the Clintons' part.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Kurtz, The Washington Post, 1998-11-23&lt;/ref&gt;

The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose around improper access to [[FBI]] security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations. In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity. Ray's report further stated &quot;there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved&quot; in seeking the files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/07/28/clinton.filegate/|title=No substantial and credible evidence, CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Death penalty====
{{see|Capital punishment in Arkansas|Capital punishment by the United States federal government}}

The application of the federal death penalty was expanded to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise, by Clinton's 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, &quot;''My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/102496-speech-by-president-to-the-people-of-new-orlean-la.htm|title=William J Clinton Foundation Speech by President to the People of New Orleans, LA, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While campaigning for U.S. President, then-Governor Clinton returned to Arkansas to see that [[Ricky Ray Rector]] would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but didn't understand the concept of death. According to Arkansas state and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the claim of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in a [[New York Times]] article as a possible political move to counter &quot;soft on crime&quot; accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Applebome|first=Peter|title=Arkansas Execution Raises Questions on Governor's Politics|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEED91F3EF936A15752C0A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=1992-01-25|accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;mbsrgd&quot;&gt;[[George Stephanopoulos]], ''All Too Human: A Political Education'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years who switched positions.&lt;ref name = &quot;mbsrgd&quot;/&gt; During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty was re-enacted on March 23, 1973&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state/ Death Penalty Information Center]&lt;/ref&gt;). As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by [[electric chair]] and three by [[lethal injection]]. However, Clinton was the first President to pardon a death row inmate since the federal death penalty was reintroduced in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=126&amp;scid=13 |title=Clemency |publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal executions were resumed under his successor [[George W. Bush]].

===Second term, 1997&amp;ndash;2001===
[[Image:Clinton Karlspreis.jpg|thumb|Clinton receiving the 2000 [[Charlemagne Prize]] for his work toward [[European integration]].]]

In the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]], Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2% of the popular vote over Republican [[Bob Dole]] (40.7% of the popular vote) and [[Reform Party USA|Reform]] candidate [[Ross Perot]] (8.4% of the popular vote), becoming the first Democrat to win presidential reelection since Franklin Roosevelt. The Republicans lost a few seats in the House and gained a few in the Senate, but overall retained control of the Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70% of the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.

====Lewinsky scandal====
{{Main|Lewinsky scandal}}
Clinton's sexual relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Time Line |work=Washington Post Special Report: Clinton Accused |date=September 13, 1998 |page=A32 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/timeline.htm |publisher=The Washington Post | accessdate =2007-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a 22-year-old White House intern named [[Monica Lewinsky]] resulted in the [[Lewinsky scandal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; In a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] session after the 1998 elections, the House [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|voted to impeach Clinton]], based on allegations Clinton lied about his relationship with Lewinsky in a sworn [[deposition]] in the [[Paula Jones]] lawsuit. This made Clinton only the second U.S. president to be impeached after [[Andrew Johnson]].

=====Impeachment and trial in the Senate=====
{{main|Impeachment of Bill Clinton}}
The House held no serious impeachment hearings before the [[U.S. midterm election|mid-term elections]]. Though the mid-term elections held in November 1998 were at the 6-year point in an 8-year presidency (a time in the electoral cycle where the party holding the White House usually loses Congressional seats) the Democratic Party gained several seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot;&gt;''The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House,'' John F. Harris , 2005, ISBN 0-375-50847-3&lt;/ref&gt; To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] session in December 1998.

[[Image:Senate in session.jpg|thumb|left|The impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, [[William H. Rehnquist|Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist]] presiding.]]

While the [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings ended in a straight party line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely on the basis of Republican support but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]]. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony about his relationship to [[Monica Lewinsky]] during a sexual harassment lawsuit (later dismissed, appealed and settled for $850,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/pjones.htm|title=Case Closed, Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought by former Arkansas state employee [[Paula Jones]]. The obstruction charge was based on his actions during the subsequent investigation of that testimony. The Senate later voted to acquit Clinton on both charges.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;CNN-Clinton_aquiter&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate refused to convene to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm [[Williams &amp; Connolly]].

The Senate concluded a twenty-one day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote on both counts falling short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an office holder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty. Some Republicans voted not guilty for both charges. On the perjury charge, fifty-five senators voted to acquit, including ten Republicans, and forty-five voted to convict; on the obstruction charge the Senate voted 50-50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the senators voted on impeachment |publisher=CNN |date=February 12, 1999 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/senate.vote/ |accessdate=2009-1-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital Millennium Copyright Act====
Clinton enacted the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] on October 21, 1998. It served as the first significant amendment to the [[United States Copyright Act|Copyright Act]] since 1976. The DMCA extended the protection of [[intellectual property]] to outlaw [[reverse engineering]] of digital protection. It provided a framework for [[record label|sound recording copyright owners]] and recording artists to seek public performance royalties under statute, which proved to be a landmark achievement for the recording industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Senate Ratifies Historic Treaties Securing Copyright Online |date=October 21, 1998 |url=http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/press1998/102198.asp |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |accessdate=2007-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military and foreign events====
Three notable military events occurred during Clinton's second term. In Clinton's [[State of the Union Address]], Clinton warned Congress of Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein's]] pursuit of nuclear weapons:

[[File:Bill Clinton 1995 im Parlament in London.jpg|thumb|right|174px|President Clinton in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]], June [[1995]].]]

{{cquote|Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons, and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them. Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, &quot;You cannot defy the will of the world,&quot; and when I say to him, &quot;You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Senate Ratifies Historic Treaties Securing Copyright Online |date=January 27, 1998 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/states/docs/sou98.htm|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

To weaken Saddam Hussein's grip of power, Clinton signed H.R. 4655 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of &quot;regime change&quot; against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not speak to the use of American military forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4655.ENR: Iraq Liberation Act of 1998], H.R.4655, One Hundred Fifth Congress of United States of America at Second Session; Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/libera.htm The Iraq Liberation Act, Statement by the President], Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release, October 31, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named [[Operation Desert Fox]], lasting from December 16 to December 19, 1998.

The [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] also occurred in [[Somalia]] in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. [[MH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopters were shot down by [[rocket-propelled grenade]] attacks to their [[tail rotor]]s, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets and broadcasted on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground.

[[General Wesley Clark]] was [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe#Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)|Supreme Allied Commander of NATO]] and oversaw the mission.

After initial successes such as the [[Oslo accords]] of the early 1990s, Clinton attempted to address the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]]. Clinton brought Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] and Palestinian Authority Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] together at [[Camp David]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; However, the [[Camp David 2000 Summit|negotiations]] were ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; The situation broke down completely with the start of the [[Second Intifada]].

====Whitewater controversy====
{{main|Whitewater (controversy)}}
The Whitewater controversy was an [[United States|American]] political controversy that began with the [[real estate]] dealings of Bill and [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]] and their associates, [[Jim McDougal|Jim]] and [[Susan McDougal]] in the [[Whitewater Development Corporation]], a failed business venture in the 1970s and 1980s.

[[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]], the source of criminal allegations against President Bill Clinton in the Whitewater affair, claimed in November 1993 that Bill Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater land deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon031798&quot;&gt;[[Jonathan Broder]] and [[Murray Waas]], [http://www.salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_17news.html &quot;The road to Hale&quot;], [[Salon.com]], March 17, 1998. Accessed August 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] investigation did result in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains innocence in the affair.

Capturing Osama bin Laden has been an objective of the United States government since the presidency of Bill Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/24/clinton.binladen/index.html Bill Clinton: I got closer to killing bin Laden&lt;/ref&gt;  On three separate occasions in 1996, 1998, and 2000, while the Clinton Administration had begun pursuit of the policy, the Sudanese government offered to arrest and extradite Bin Laden as well as to provide the United States detailed intelligence information about growing militant organizations in the region, including [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05 Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastisize.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though U.S. authorities knew of bin Laden's involvement in bombings on an American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, they rejected each offer.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05 Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastisize.&lt;/ref&gt;  Three months after the final offer in 2000, al Qaeda operatives bombed the [[USS Cole (DDG-67)|U.S.S. Cole]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05 Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastisize.&lt;/ref&gt;  On [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], members of al Qaeda carried out an attack on the [[World Trade Center]] and the [[Pentagon]].  Mansoor Ijaz, a former member of the CIA who participated directly in the United States' negotiations with Sudan for bin Laden, concludes, &quot;Clinton's failure to grasp the opportunity to unravel increasingly organized extremists, coupled with Berger's assessments of their potential to directly threaten the U.S., represents one of the most serious foreign policy failures in American history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05 Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastisize.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law license suspension===
In a separate case, Clinton was ordered to pay $25,000 in fines to Arkansas state's bar officials and his Arkansas law license was suspended for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton to contest Supreme Court suspension |publisher=CNN |date=October 2, 2001 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/LAW/10/01/scotus.clinton/ |accessdate=2006-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement came on the condition that Whitewater prosecutors would not pursue federal [[perjury]] charges against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill Clinton Disbarment to End |publisher=AP/11alive.com |date=January 18, 2006 |url=http://www.11alive.com/rss/article.aspx?storyid=74815 |accessdate=2006-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton was suspended by the Supreme Court in October 2001, and, facing disbarment from that court, Clinton resigned from the Supreme Court bar in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton asks to quit Supreme Court Bar |publisher=CNN.com |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/11/09/clinton.bar/ |date=November 9, 2001 |accessdate=2007-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Troopergate===
{{main|Troopergate (Bill Clinton)}}
Troopergate is the popular name of an alleged [[scandal]] involving allegations by two [[Arkansas]] state troopers that they arranged sexual liaisons for then-[[governor]] Bill Clinton. The allegations by state troopers [[Larry Patterson]] and Roger Perry were first reported by [[David Brock]] in [[the American Spectator]] in 1993. The story mentioned a woman named ''Paula'', a reference to [[Paula Jones]]. The troopers were discovered to have been paid for their stories and Brock later admitted journalistic dishonesty and apologized.

===Pardons and campaign finance===
{{main|Bill Clinton pardons controversy|1996 United States campaign finance controversy}}
Clinton issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010120/aponline135239_000.htm &quot;Clinton Pardon's List&quot;], ''[[Associated Press]] via [[The Washington Post]]'', 2001-01-20&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the controversy surrounded [[Marc Rich]] and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, [[Hugh Rodham]], accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton pardons: Cast of characters |publisher=BBC |date=February 22, 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1184118.stm |accessdate=2006-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Clinton's pardons remain a point of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Curl, Joseph, [http://washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070706/NATION/107060099/1001 &quot;Clintons hit over Libby criticism&quot;], ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, prior to and during the Clinton administration and also involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.&lt;ref name=embassy&gt;Woodward, Bob and Duffy, Brian, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/china1.htm &quot;Chinese Embassy Role In Contributions Probed&quot;], ''Washington Post'', February 13, 1997

==Public approval==
[[Image:Clinton approval rating.png|thumb|300px|Clinton's [[United States Presidential approval rating|approval rating]]s throughout his presidential career]]

Clinton's job approval rating ranged from 36% in mid-1993 to 64% in late 1993 and early 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/cgi-bin/hsrun.exe/Roperweb/PresJob/PresJob.htx;start=HS_fullresults?pr=Clinton|title=Job Performance Ratings for President Clinton|accessdate=2006-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second term, his rating was consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollingreport.com/clinton-.htm Bill Clinton: Job Ratings] - PollingReport.com&lt;/ref&gt; After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point at 73% approval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/20/impeachment.poll/ Poll: Clinton's approval rating up in wake of impeachment] - [[CNN]], 1998-12-20&lt;/ref&gt; He finished with an approval rating of 68%, which was higher than that of any other departing president since polling began more than seventy years earlier.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

As he was leaving office, a CNN/USA TODAY/Gallup poll revealed 45% said they'd miss him. While 55% thought he &quot;would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life&quot;, 68% thought he'd be remembered for his &quot;involvement in personal scandal&quot;, and 58% answered &quot;No&quot; to the question &quot;Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?&quot;. 47% of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters. 47% said he would be remembered as either &quot;outstanding&quot; or &quot;above average&quot; as a president while 22% said he would be remembered as &quot;below average&quot; or &quot;poor&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;CNN-Clinton-gone&quot;&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/10/cnn.poll.clinton/ Poll: Majority of Americans glad Clinton is leaving office] - Keating Holland, [[CNN]], 2001-01-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gallup Organization]] published a poll in February 2007 asking respondents to name the greatest president in U.S. history; Clinton came in fourth place, capturing 13% of the vote. In a 2006 [[Quinnipiac University]] poll asking respondents to name the best president since [[World War II]], Clinton ranked 3% behind [[Ronald Reagan]] to place second with 25% of the vote. However, in the same poll, when respondents were asked to name the worst president since World War II, Clinton placed 1% behind [[Richard Nixon]] and 18% behind [[George W. Bush]] to come in third with 16% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pollingreport.com/wh-hstry.htm |title=Presidents and History |publisher=pollingreport.com |accessdate=2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/12/bush.clinton.poll/index.html Poll: Clinton outperformed Bush] - CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[ABC News]] characterized public consensus on Clinton as, &quot;You can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics{{ndash}} and he's done a heck of a good job.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/DailyNews/poll_clintonlegacy010117.html Poll: Clinton Legacy Mixed], ABCNews.com, January 17, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clinton's 65% Gallup Poll approval rating was also the highest Gallup approval rating of any [[Post-war|Postwar]] President leaving office, one point ahead of [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;C)(0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uspolitics.about.com/od/polls/l/bl_historical_approval.htm |title=Historical Presidential Approval Ratings - End Of Term Plus Current Ratings |publisher=Uspolitics.about.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public image==
{{main|Public image of Bill Clinton}}
[[Image:ClintonChild.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Clinton reading with a child in [[Chicago]], September, 1998.]]

As the first [[Baby Boomer]] president, Clinton was the first president in a half-century not to have been shaped by [[World War II]]. Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward state Clinton's innovative use of [[soundbite]]-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning was major for his high public approval ratings.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Walker, Clinton: the President they deserve, Fourth Estate 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Woodward, The choice: how Clinton won, Touchstone 1996, ISBN 0-684-81308-4&lt;/ref&gt; When Clinton played the saxophone on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', Clinton was sometimes described as &quot;the [[MTV]] president.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bresler |first=Robert J. |title=The Muddled Meaning of the 2000 Election |publisher=USA Today (Society for the Advancement of Education)

===Popularity among African-Americans===
Clinton drew strong support from the [[African American]] community and made improving race relations a major theme of his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&amp;amp;b=122950 A Conversation With President Bill Clinton on Race in America Today] - interview with Clinton, [[Center for American Progress]], July 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Toni Morrison]] in [[The New Yorker]] called Clinton &quot;the first [[African American candidates for president of the United States#&quot;Black presidents&quot;|Black president]],&quot; saying, &quot;Clinton displays almost every trope of [[blackness]]: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, [[McDonald's]]-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas,&quot; and comparing Clinton's sex life, scrutinized despite his career accomplishments, to the stereotyping and [[double standards]] that blacks typically endure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison |first=Toni |authorlink=Toni Morrison|coauthors= |title=Clinton as the first black president |work= |publisher=The New Yorker|month=October |year=1998|url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu./smith/clinton/morrison.html|format= |doi= |accessdate=2006-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Sexual misconduct allegations===
Throughout his career, Clinton has been subject to various allegations of sexual misconduct, though only his extramarital sexual relationships with Lewinsky and Flowers have been admitted by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E4D91739F937A25750C0A96E958260| title=TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE ACCUSER; JONES LAWYERS ISSUE FILES ALLEGING CLINTON PATTERN OF HARASSMENT OF WOMEN| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=1998-03-14| quote=The Presidential deposition released today confirmed several revelations reported earlier, including Mr. Clinton's confirmation... that he had had sex with Gennifer Flowers, a one-time Arkansas worker. | accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For alleged misconduct during his governorship [[Paula Jones]] brought a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton while he was president. Clinton argued that as a sitting president, he should not be vulnerable to a civil suit of this nature. The case landed in the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that &quot;Deferral of this litigation until petitioner's Presidency ends is not constitutionally required.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clinton v. Jones, No. 95-1853 http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=95-1853&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a U.S. judge in Arkansas, [[Susan Webber Wright]], ruled that since Jones had not suffered any damages, the case should be dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/docs/order040198.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This judge had been one of Clinton's students at the University of Arkansas. On April 2, 1998, Judge [[Susan Webber Wright]] dismissed Jones' lawsuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;JO#$&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/02/clinton.jones.reax/ |title=Clinton Welcomes Jones Decision; Appeal Likely - April 2, 1998 |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month Jones filed an appeal and won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/docs/reqad1.htm |title=washingtonpost.com: Jones v. Clinton Resources and Links |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 1998, Clinton agreed to an out-of-court settlement, and agreed to pay Jones and her attorneys a sum of $850,000.00.&lt;ref name=&quot;CO{}{&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/11/18/jones/ |title=Appeals court ponders Paula Jones settlement - November 18, 1998 |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clinton, however, still offered no apology to Jones and still denied ever engaging in a sexual affair with her.&lt;ref name=&quot;CO{}{&quot; /&gt;

In 1998, [[Kathleen Willey]] and [[Juanita Broaddrick]] alleged sexual assault against Clinton.  The claims were never brought before a court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/broaddrick022599.htm|title=Clinton Accuser's Story Aired, Washington Post, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gennifer Flowers]], [[Elizabeth Ward Gracen]], [[Sally Perdue]] and Dolly Kyle Browning - claimed to have had [[Adultery|adulterous]] sexual relations with Clinton during or before his service as governor. Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton for having sex with Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/25/clinton.gracen/ |title=Former Miss America Apologizes To First Lady - April 25, 1998 |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolly Kyle Browning alleged that she and Clinton engaged in a long sexual affair between the years of 1959 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/16/jones.clinton.docs/dolly.browning.declaration/&lt;/ref&gt; Browning began writing a &quot;semi-autobiographical novel&quot; about the affair and claims that in the publication process, Clinton tried to prohibit and undermine publication. Browning sued Clinton for damages, but the US Court of Appeals would deny her appeal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/dc/opinions/01opinions/01-5050a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security incidents==
[[Frank Eugene Corder]] crashed a stolen [[Cessna 150]] onto the South Lawn of the [[White House]] early on September 12, 1994, apparently trying to hit the building; he was the sole casualty.

On 29 October 1994, [[Francisco Martin Duran]] fired 29 rounds from an [[assault rifle]] at the White House. He was later convicted of attempting to assassinate a [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] and sentenced to 40 years in prison.

Clinton spoke for the fifth consecutive time at the [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] on July 26, 2004, praising candidate [[John Kerry]]. He said of President George W. Bush's depiction of Kerry, &quot;strength and wisdom are not opposing values.&quot; Despite Clinton's speech, the post-convention bounce to Kerry's poll numbers was less than was hoped for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Page |first=Susan |title=Poll: No boost for Kerry after convention |publisher=USA TODAY |date=August 1, 2004 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-08-01-poll-kerry_x.htm |accessdate=2007-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in [[North America]] and [[Europe]], Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year, earning $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Gerstein, ''Clinton Eligible, Once Again, To Practice Law'', New York Sun, January 17, 2006, downloaded from [http://www.nysun.com/article/25965?page_no=2 N.Y.

Clinton made his first visit to new [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] in April 2007. The 45-minute meeting, called at Clinton's request, touched on a host of topics, including disease, war, famine and poverty in Africa, especially in the [[Darfur]] region. The [[Middle East]], the conflict in Iraq, and Iran's nuclear standoff with the U.N. were on the agenda, as well as HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/4/13/121244.shtml Bill Clinton's Strange U.N.

Clinton served as one of the organizers for the [[New Baptist Covenant]] alongside former President [[Jimmy Carter]] and other Baptist leaders. This effort sought to bring various Baptists in America together, especially across racial lines, to discuss issues that unite them. Clinton spoke at the January 2008 celebration in Atlanta, GA.

===William Clinton Foundation===
{{main|William J. Clinton Foundation}}
The William J. Clinton Foundation promotes and provides for a number of humanitarian causes. Within the foundation, the Clinton Foundation [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] Initiative (CHAI) strives to make treatment for HIV/AIDS more affordable and to implement large-scale integrated care, treatment, and prevention programs. While in [[Sydney]] to attend a Global Business Forum, Clinton signed a memorandum of understanding on behalf of his presidential foundation with the Australian government to promote HIV/AIDS programs in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.

[[Image:Bush and Clinton.jpg|thumb|left|Clinton with former President [[George H. W. Bush]] in January 2005.]]
The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), funded by the Clinton Foundation, was inaugurated September September 15-17, 2005 in New York City to coincide with the [[2005 World Summit]]. The focus areas of the initiative include attempts to address world problems such as global [[public health]], [[poverty]] alleviation and religious and [[ethnic conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/|title=Clinton Global Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton announced through the [[William J. Clinton Foundation]] an agreement by major soft drink manufacturers to stop selling sugared sodas and juice drinks, in public primary and secondary schools within the United States,
on May 3, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcast.net/news/index.jsp?cat=GENERAL&amp;fn=/2006/05/03/383279.html|title=William J. Clinton Foundation announces agreement to reduce junk food in schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation has received donations from a number of foreign governments, including the [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|king of Morocco]], a foundation linked to the [[United Arab Emirates]], and the governments of [[Kuwait]] and [[Qatar]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/obama-team-turns-scrutiny-on-bill-clinton-20081117-692j.html|title=Obama team turns scrutiny on Bill Clinton, The Age, 18 Nov 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 newspapers reported that &quot;Mr Clinton had travelled to [[Kazakhstan]] with a Canadian mining magnate, [[Frank Giustra]], to meet its dictator president. Mr Giustra later won three lucrative uranium mining contracts from the government and then donated $US31 million to Mr Clinton's charity.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au&quot;/&gt;

===Relations with George H. W. Bush===
In the aftermath of the [[Indian Ocean tsunami|Asian tsunami]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]], Clinton established, with fellow former-President George H. W. Bush, the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund and Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund, for which they were awarded the 2006 [[Philadelphia Liberty Medal]] on October 5, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitutioncenter.org/libertymedal/|title=2006 Philadelphia Liberty Medal Award}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spoke together at the funeral of [[Boris Yeltsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,268092,00.html|title=Former Presidents Bush, Clinton Represent U.S. at Boris Yeltsin's Funeral, Fox News, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then-President George W. Bush, to help the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], named Clinton and [[George H. W. Bush]] to lead a nationwide campaign on January 3, 2005. U.N. Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] selected Clinton to head the [[United Nations]] [[Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|earthquake and tsunami relief and reconstruction effort]] on February 1, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/02/01/clinton.tsunami/index.html|title=Clinton named head of U.N. tsunami rebuilding, CNN, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five days later, to raise money for relief through the [[USA Freedom Corps]], Clinton and Bush appeared on the [[Fox Television Network|Fox]] [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] pre-game show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39788-2005Jan26.html|title=Senior Bush, Clinton to Appear at Super Bowl, Washington Post, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen days later, to see the relief efforts, they traveled to the affected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4281627.stm|title=Bush, Clinton end tsunami visit, BBC News, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
To create the Clinton Foundation Climate Change Initiative (CCI), the [[William J. Clinton Foundation]] entered into a partnership with the [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group]] on August 1, 2006, agreeing to provide resources to allow the participating cities to enter into an energy-saving product purchasing consortium and to provide technical and communications support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/080106-nr-cf-cci-pr-president-clinton-launches-clinton-climate-initiative.htm|title=Clinton Foundation and Climate Partnership, Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control while speaking at the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Montreal]] on December 9, 2005. To promote initiatives concerning the [[environmentalism|environment]], Clinton twice visited the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 2006. First, to advertise the [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group]], he met with [[Tony Blair]], [[Ken Livingstone]], [[Antonio Villaraigosa]], and [[Gavin Newsom]] on August 1, 2006. On October 13, 2006, he spoke in favor of [[California Proposition 87 (2006)|California Proposition 87]] on [[Energy development|alternative energy]], which was voted down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peach |last=Indravudh |coauthors= |title=Clinton backs Prop. 87 |date= |publisher=[[UCLA]] |url=http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/2006/oct/16/clinton-backs-prop-87/ |work=Daily Bruin |pages= |accessdate=2007-07-19 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal health===
Clinton had an episode of [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and was evaluated at Northern Westchester Hospital on September 2, 2004. It was determined he did not suffer a [[coronary infarction]], and he was sent home, returning the following day for [[angiography]], which disclosed multiple vessel [[coronary artery disease]]. He was transferred to [[Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center]] in New York City, where he underwent a successful quadruple [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] on September 6, 2004. The medical team stated, had he not had surgery, he would have likely suffered a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] within a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vedantam |first=Shankar |title=Clinton's Heart Bypass Surgery Called a Success |page=A01 |publisher=The Washington Post |date=September 7, 2004 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A409-2004Sep6.html |accessdate=2007-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his open-heart surgery, he underwent a follow-up surgery to remove scar tissue and fluid from his left chest cavity on March 10, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/03/09/news/clinton.php|title=Clinton follow-up surgery, International Herald Tribune, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since recovered.

===2008 election involvement===
In the course of the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign]], Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, [[Hillary Clinton]], leading some observers and party members to question the appropriateness of his role in view of his status as a former president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-01-24-2496190579_x.htm The Associated Press: Quotes on Bill Clinton's Campaign Role&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some felt that Clinton was overshadowing his wife in the campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-assess_tackett_sunjan27,0,5782634.story |title=For better or worse, Bill Clinton in race - chicagotribune.com |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |author=Michael Tackett and January 27, 2008 |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/ontheweb/blogs/daily/2008/01/bruce-feirste-1.html |title=VF Daily: Bruce Feirstein: Bill Clinton, Nasty Man: On The Web: vanityfair.com |publisher=Vanityfair.com |author=Bruce Feirstein |date=January 25, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/627lchzc.asp |title=The Bubba Factor |publisher=Weeklystandard.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; with her presidential rival [[Barack Obama]] complaining that he sometimes &quot;did not know which Clinton he was running against.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-brooks24jan24,0,1569475.column |title=A Clinton twofer's high price - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a MSNBC debate, Republican primary candidate [[Mitt Romney]] said that he &quot;can't imagine Bill Clinton left with nothing to do in the White House&quot;, suggesting that Clinton would be a &quot;co-president and try and help manage the economy and help manage the world affairs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/01/26/611577.aspx Romney on McCain, the Clintons], Posted: Saturday, January 26, 2008 3:19 PM by Mark Murray&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bill Clinton @ Hillary Rally.jpg|thumb|left|Clinton speaking at a rally for his wife at [[Dickinson College]].]]
Top Democratic Party officials, including Rep. [[Rahm Emanuel]], chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and a declared Clinton supporter, asked Clinton to tone down his attacks on Obama following the bitterly contested Nevada caucus, suggesting that Clinton could be damaging his own political capital and global stature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/96385 |title=Leading Democrats To Bill Clinton: Pipe Down &amp;#124; Newsweek Periscope &amp;#124; Newsweek.com |publisher=Newsweek.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators even accused the former president of &quot;playing the race card&quot; against Obama, who is half-black, by suggesting he would understand if South Carolina's African Americans naturally would vote for the black candidate, but rejected suggestions that America was not ready for a black President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&amp;sid=a86pY4CBoF0U |title=Bloomberg.com: News |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2182569#obamaescape |title=Obama beats...

Following his wife's disappointing defeat in South Carolina, Clinton again made headlines when he appeared to undermine and racialize Obama's victory by comparing it to [[Jesse Jackson]]'s failed 1984 bid for the Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqd2dfjl2pw |title=YouTube - Bill Clinton on Barack Obama |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers suggested that the controversial comments fueled Sen.

During the primary campaign, his wife's aides criticized Clinton's freelancing and deemed his office uncooperative{{ndash}} at one point, they complained, his people would not allow one of her people to ride on his plane to campaign stops. His aides, on the other hand, stewed over what they saw as her people's disregard for the advice of one of this generation's great political minds and bristled at surrendering control of his schedule. On the night of the [[Pennsylvania Democratic primary, 2008|Pennsylvania primary]], Clinton grew playfully competitive with his wife over who had done more events or had had more impact. Governor [[Ed Rendell]] showed Clinton the county-by-county returns, while she was superstitious and rarely watched election night coverage. According to Rendell, &quot;The president wanted to know exactly what the returns were in the places he had been and Hillary hadn't been. He kept showing Hillary, and she would laugh.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Due to Clinton's prominent role in his wife's presidential run and his criticism of Obama, many perceived an enduring distance between the two. Clinton was asked later if he thought presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]] was qualified to be president. He replied that the Constitution sets qualifications. When pressed as to whether Obama was &quot;ready&quot; to be president, Clinton replied, &quot;You could argue that no one is ready to be president.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/151388/output/print|publisher=Newsweek|author=Jonathan Alter|accessdate=2008-08-28|title=A Catharsis in Denver?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008 when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 [[Democratic National Convention]], saying that all his experience as president assures him that Obama is &quot;ready to lead&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2008/08/bill_clinton_vouches_for_obama.html|title=Bill Clinton vouches for Obama: now &quot;ready to lead.&quot;|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=Sun-Times News Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;
