'''Austria''' {{Audio-IPA|en-us-Austria.ogg|[ˈɔːstɹiə]}} ({{lang-de|Österreich}}) ({{Audio|Österreich.ogg|Österreich}}), officially the '''Republic of Austria''' ({{lang-de|Republik Österreich}}) ({{Audio|Republik Österreich.ogg|Republik Österreich}}), is a [[landlocked]] country in [[Central Europe]].
It borders both [[Germany]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the north, [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] to the east, [[Slovenia]] and [[Italy]] to the south, and [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] to the west. The [[capital]] is the city of [[Vienna]] on the [[Danube River]].&lt;ref&gt;CIA map 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of Austria date back to the ninth century, when the territory of Upper and Lower Austria became increasingly populated. The name &quot;Ostarrichi&quot; is first documented in an official document from 996. Since then this word has developed into the ''Österreich''.&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 4&quot;&gt;Brook-Shepherd 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria is a [[parliamentary government|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]] comprising nine federal states&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 17&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 17&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of six European countries that have declared [[neutral country|permanent neutrality]]&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson neutral&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the few countries that includes the concept of everlasting neutrality in its [[constitution]]. Austria has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since 1955&lt;ref&gt;Jelavich 267&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the [[European Union]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;CIA par. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[German language|German]] name {{lang|de|''Österreich''}} is derived from [[Old High German|Old German]] {{lang|goh|''[[Ostarrîchi]]''}} &quot;Eastern Territory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;meaningofname&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Gwillim  |last=Law |url=http://www.statoids.com/uat.html |title=States of Austria  |publisher=Statoids |date=[[2006-01-09]] |accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was erroneously Latinized as &quot;{{lang|la|[[wikt:Austria|Austria]]}}&quot; (Latin ''auster'' &quot;south wind&quot;, metaphorically &quot;south&quot; thus ''austrālis'' &quot;southern&quot; and so on. There is no evidence for the region being called &quot;South&quot; anything in any other language). {{lang|de|''[[Reich]]''}} can also mean &quot;empire,&quot; and this connotation is the one that is understood in the context of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]/[[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], although not in the context of the modern Republic of {{lang|de|''Österreich''}}. The term probably originates in a [[vernacular]] translation of the [[Medieval Latin]] name for the region: {{lang|la|''Marchia orientalis''}}, which translates as &quot;eastern marches&quot; or &quot;eastern borderland&quot;, as it was situated at the eastern edge of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], that was also mirrored in the name ''[[Ostmark]]'', for a short period  applied after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' to [[Germany]].
However, [[Friedrich Heer]], one the most important Austrian historians in the 20th century, stated in his book ''Der Kampf um die österreichische Identität'' (The Struggle Over Austrian Identity), that the Germanic form ''ostarrîchi'' was not a translation of the Latin word, but both resulted from a much older term originating in the [[Celtic languages]] of ancient Austria: More than 2,500 years ago, the major part of the actual country was called ''Norig'' by the Celtic population ([[Hallstatt culture]]); ''No-'' or ''Nor-'' meant ''East'' or ''Eastern'', whereas ''Rig'' is the related to the modern German ''Reich''; realm (among other things). Accordingly, ''Norig'' would essentially mean ''ostarrîchi'' and ''Österreich'', thus ''Austria''. The Celtic name was eventually Latinized to ''noricum'', when the Romans conquered and Romanized the country that later became Austria. The name of ''Noricum'' was then used to designate the Roman province.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

The current official designation is the ''Republic of Austria'' ({{lang|de|Republik Österreich}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia government&quot;&gt;[[CIA]] § Government&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally known after the fall of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] from 1918 as the ''Republic of [[German Austria]]'' ({{lang|de|Republik Deutschösterreich}}) , but the state was forced to change its name to &quot;Republic of [[Austria]]&quot; in 1919 by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]]. The name was changed again during the [[Austro-fascist]] regime (1934–1938) , into ''Federal State of Austria'' ({{lang|de|Bundesstaat Österreich}}) , but restored after regaining independence and the birth of the Second Austrian Republic (1955 – present).

During the period of monarchy, Austria was known as the ''Austrian Empire'' ({{lang|de|Kaisertum Österreich}}) ; however no official designation existed since the empire was strongly multiethnic. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the empire became known as ''[[Austria-Hungary]]'' reflecting the [[dual monarchy]] character.&lt;!--

==History==
{{main|History of Austria}}
Settled in prehistoric times,&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 17&quot; /&gt; the [[central Europe]]an land that is now Austria was occupied in pre-Roman times by various [[Celt]]ic tribes. The Celtic kingdom of [[Noricum]] was later claimed by the [[Roman Empire]] and made a province. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the area was invaded by [[Bavarians]], [[Slavs]] and [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 19&quot;/&gt;. [[Charlemagne]] conquered the area in 788 encouraged colonization and introduced [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 19&quot;&gt;Johnson 19&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of [[Eastern Francia]], the core areas that now encompass Austria were bequeathed to the house of [[Babenberg]]. The area was known as the ''[[March of Austria|marchia Orientalis]]'' and was given to [[Leopold I of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold of Babenberg]] in 976.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 20&quot;&gt;Johnson 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wappen röm.kaiser.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Coats of arms of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Emperor]]

The first record showing the name Austria is from 996 where it is written as ''[[Ostarrîchi]]'', referring to the territory of the Babenberg March.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 20&quot;/&gt; In 1156 the [[Privilegium Minus]] elevated Austria to the status of a duchy. In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]]. With the death of [[Frederick II of Austria|Frederick II]] in 1246, the line of the Babenbergs went extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 21&quot;&gt;Johnson 21&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Otakar II of Bohemia]] effectively assumed control of the duchies of Austria, Styria and [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 21&quot;/&gt; His reign came to an end with his defeat at [[Dürnkrut]] at the hands of [[Rudolf I of Germany]] in 1278.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 23&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, until World War I, Austria's history was largely that of its ruling dynasty, the [[Habsburgs]].

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the Duchy of Austria. In 1438, Duke [[Albert V of Austria]] was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, [[Emperor Sigismund]]. Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, from then on, every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.

The Habsburgs began also to accumulate lands far from the Hereditary Lands. In 1477, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Maximilian]], only son of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]], married the heiress Maria of [[Burgundy]], thus acquiring most of the [[Low Countries]] for the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 25&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 11&quot;&gt;Brook-Shepherd 11&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Fair]] married the heiress of [[Castile]] and [[Aragon]], and thus acquired [[Spain]] and its Italian, African, and New World appendages for the Habsburgs.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 11&quot;/&gt; In 1526, following the [[Battle of Mohács]], [[Bohemia]] and the part of [[Hungary]] not occupied by the Ottomans came under Austrian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 26&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman expansion into Hungary led to frequent conflicts between the two empires, particularly evident in the so-called [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] of 1593 to 1606.

During the long reign of [[Emperor Leopold I|Leopold I]] (1657–1705) and following the successful defense of [[Battle of Vienna|Vienna]] in 1683 (under the command of the King of Poland, [[John III Sobieski]]),&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 26–28&lt;/ref&gt; a series of campaigns resulted in bringing all of Hungary to Austrian control by the [[Treaty of Carlowitz]] in 1699. [[Emperor Charles VI]] relinquished many of the fairly impressive gains the empire made in the previous years, largely due to his apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the House of Habsburg. Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for other powers' worthless recognitions of the [[Pragmatic Sanction]] that made his daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] his heir. With the rise of [[Prussia]] the [[German dualism|Austrian–Prussian dualism]] began in Germany.
Austria participated, together with Prussia and Russia, in the first and the third of the three [[Partitions of Poland]] (in 1772 and 1795).

[[Image:CongressVienna.jpg|thumb|left|225px|''The Congress of Vienna'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]], 1819.]]

Austria later became engaged in a war with [[Revolutionary France]] - at the beginning highly  unsuccessful - with successive defeats at the hands of [[Napoleon]] meaning the end of the old [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806. Two years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 34&lt;/ref&gt; in 1804, the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] was founded. In 1814 Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the [[Napoleonic wars]]. It thus emerged from the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as one of four of the continent's dominant powers. The same year, the [[German Confederation]], ({{lang-de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded under the presidency of Austria. Because of unsolved social, political and national conflicts the German lands where shaken by the [[1848 revolution]] aiming to create a unified Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 36&quot;&gt;Johnson 36&lt;/ref&gt; A unified Germany [[Image:franzferdinand.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] (right) with his family.]] would have been possible either as a Greater Germany, or a Greater Austria or just the [[German Confederation]] without Austria at all. As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the [[Unification of Germany|German Empire of 1848]]  the crown of the new formed empire was offered to the Prussian King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]]. In 1864 Austria and [[Prussia]] fought together against [[Denmark]], and successfully freed the independent duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. Nevertheless as they could not agree on a solution to the administration of the two duchies, they fought in 1866 the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. Defeated by Prussia in the [[Battle of Königgrätz]],&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 36&quot;/&gt; Austria had to leave the [[German Confederation]] and subsequently no longer took part in German politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 55&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schulze 233&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the ''Ausgleich'', provided for a dual sovereignty, the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], under [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 59&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian-Hungarian rule of this diverse empire included various [[Slav]] groups such as [[Poles]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Czechoslovakia|Czechs]], [[Czechoslovakia|Slovaks]], [[Slovenes]], [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]], as well as large [[Italian people|Italian]] and [[Romania]]n communities. As a result, ruling Austria-Hungary became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements.  Yet the central government tried its best to be accommodating in some respects;  minorities were entitled to schools in their own language, for example. The assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914 by [[Gavrilo Princip]] (a member of the Serbian nationalist group the [[Black Hand]])&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; was the immediate cause for the outbreak of World War I, leading to the dissolution of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. The Empire was broken up according to the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]]) and the remaining subordinate territories became independent states. However, over 3 million  German Austrians found themselves living outside of the newborn Austrian Republic in the respective states of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 246&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1918 and 1919, Austria was officially known as the Republic of [[German Austria]] ({{lang|de|''Republik Deutschösterreich''}}). Not only did the [[Allies of World War I|Entente powers]] forbid German Austria to unite with Germany, they also forbade the name; it was therefore changed to the Republic of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 245&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchy was dissolved in 1919 and a parliamentary democracy was set up under the constitution of 10 November 1920.

[[Image:Austria-Hungary map.svg|thumb|right|225px|Map of Austria-Hungary]]

In the autumn  of 1922, Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 257-8&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilize the currency, and improve its general economic condition.  With the granting of the loan, Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations. The [[First Austrian Republic]], lasted until 1933 when Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] dissolved parliament and established an autocratic regime tending towards Italian fascism.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 104&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 269&quot;&gt;Brook-Shepherd 269-70&lt;/ref&gt;
The two big parties at this time — the Social Democrats and the Conservatives — had paramilitary armies, which fought each other&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 261&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Austrian Civil War|civil war]] broke out.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 104&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 269&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 107&quot;&gt;Johnson 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1934, several members of the Schutzbund were executed,&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 283&lt;/ref&gt; the Social Democratic party was outlawed and many of its members were imprisoned or emigrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 107&quot;/&gt; In May of that year the Fascists introduced a new constitution (&quot;[[Maiverfassung]]&quot;) which cemented Dollfuss's power but on 25 July he was assassinated in a [[Nazi]] coup attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 292&lt;/ref&gt; His successor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], struggled to keep Austria independent, but on 12 March 1938 German troops occupied the country&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 112&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 112–3&lt;/ref&gt; and established a plebiscite confirming union with Germany. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] a native of Austria proclaimed the annexation (''[[Anschluss]]'') of Austria by Germany. Austria was incorporated into the [[Third Reich]] and ceased to exist as an independent state. The Nazis called Austria &quot;[[Ostmark]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 112&quot;/&gt; until 1942 when it was again renamed and called &quot;Alpen-Donau-Reichsgaue.&quot; Vienna fell on 13 April 1945 during the Soviet [[Vienna Offensive]] just before the total collapse of the Third Reich. [[Karl Renner]] astutely set up a Provisional Government in [[Vienna]] in April with the tacit approval of the victorious Soviet forces,&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 135&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 135–6&lt;/ref&gt; and declared Austria's secession from the Third Reich.

Much like Germany, Austria, too, was divided into a British, a French, a Soviet and an American Zone and governed by the [[Allied Commission for Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 137&lt;/ref&gt; Largely owing to [[Karl Renner]]'s action on April 27th in setting up a Provisional Government, however, there was a subtle difference in the treatment of Austria by the Allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 135&quot;/&gt; The Austrian Government was recognized and tolerated by the Four Powers. Austria, in general, was treated as though it had been originally invaded by Germany and liberated by the Allies. On 15 May 1955 Austria regained full independence by concluding the [[Austrian State Treaty]] with the Four Occupying Powers. On 26 October 1955 Austria was declared &quot;permanently neutral&quot; by act of Parliament, which it remains to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 153&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 153&lt;/ref&gt;

The political system of the Second Republic came to be characterized by the system of ''[[Proporz]]'', meaning that most posts of some political importance were split evenly between members of the Social Democrats and the People's Party.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 139&lt;/ref&gt; Interest group representations with mandatory membership (e.g. for workers, businesspeople, farmers etc.) grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process, so that hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 165&lt;/ref&gt; The Proporz and consensus systems largely held even up to 1983.

The country became member of the [[European Union]] in 1995&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 447,449&lt;/ref&gt; and retained its constitutional neutrality, like some other EU members, such as Sweden. The major parties SPÖ and ÖVP have contrary opinions about the future status of Austria's military neutrality: While the SPÖ supports a neutral role, the ÖVP argues for stronger integration into the EU's security policy; even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some ÖVP politicians. Since the &quot;permanent neutrality&quot; forms part of the Austrian constitution, a two-thirds majority in the Austrian parliament would be needed for such a change in policy.

The government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by [[vote of no confidence]] in the lower chamber of parliament, the [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]].

The Parliament of Austria consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat is determined every five years by a general election in which every citizen over 16 years (since 2007) is allowed to vote to fill its 183 seats. A recent extension of that term from four to five years will become effective after the next election. While there is a general threshold of 4 percent for all parties at federal elections (Nationalratswahlen), there remains the possibility to gain a direct seat, or {{lang|de|''Direktmandat''}}, in one of the 43 regional election districts. The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the [[Federal Council of Austria|Bundesrat]] has a limited right of [[veto]] (the Nationalrat can — in almost all cases — ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time. This is referred to as '''Beharrungsbeschluss'', lit. &quot;vote of persistence&quot;). A convention, called the {{lang|de|''Österreich -Konvent''}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.konvent.gv.at/ Willkommen beim Österreich Konvent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was convened in June 30, 2003 to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution, but has failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two thirds of votes in the Nationalrat necessary for constitutional amendments and/or reform. However, some important parts of the final report were generally agreed upon and are still expected to be implemented.

===Recent political developments===
In February 2000 the conservative People's Party formed a coalition with the controversial nationalistic Freedom Party, headed by [[Jörg Haider]]. The (at that time) 14 other member states of the [[European Union]] - but not the EU itself - condemned Austria's new coalition and froze diplomatic contacts. These measures were commonly referred to as &quot;sanctions&quot; although they were more or less just motions of diplomatic unfriendliness. Given the controversy, Haider chose not to join the government, but he continued to wield influence from the sidelines. This was not, however, the first time that the Republic of Austria had displeased international opinion. In 1986, the population voted for [[Kurt Waldheim]] as president despite his revelation that he had been active in the [[Wehrmacht]] as an intelligence officer during World War II.

In September 2002, the coalition between the [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] and the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] dissolved after a shake-up in the Freedom Party. In November 2002, the People's Party made large gains in general elections again. After a lot of coalition talks with other parties, the People's Party again formed a government with the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] in February 2003 with [[Wolfgang Schüssel]] as Chancellor.

After general elections held in October 2006, the Social Democrats emerged as the largest party, whereas the People's Party lost about 8% in votes. Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties. In January 2007 the People's Party and Social Democrats formed a [[Grand Coalition]] with the social democrat [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] as Chancellor.

===Foreign policy===
[[Image:Austrian embassy in London.JPG|150px|thumb|Embassy of Austria in [[London]]]]
{{main|Foreign relations of Austria}}
The 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]] ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognized Austria as an independent and sovereign state. In October 1955, the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] passed a constitutional law in which &quot;Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality.&quot; The second section of this law stated that &quot;in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory.&quot; Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality.

Austria began to reassess its definition of neutrality following the fall of the Soviet Union, granting overflight rights for the [[United Nations|UN]]-sanctioned action against [[Iraq]] in 1991, and, since 1995, contemplating participation in the [[European Union|EU's]] evolving security structure. Also in 1995, it joined the Partnership for Peace and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia.

Austria attaches great importance to participation in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and other international economic organizations, and it has played an active role in the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE).

===Energy politics===
In 1972, the country began construction of a [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] electricity-generation station at [[Zwentendorf]] on the River [[Danube]], following a unanimous vote in parliament.  However, in 1978, a [[referendum]] voted approximately 50.5% against nuclear power, 49.5% for,&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 168–9&lt;/ref&gt; and parliament subsequently unanimously passed a law forbidding the use of nuclear power to generate electricity.

Austria currently produces more than half of its electricity by [[hydropower]]. Together with other renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and biomass powerplants, the electricity supply from renewable energy amounts to nearly 80% of total use in Austria. The rest is produced by [[gas]] and [[oil]] powerplants.

==Military==
[[Image:Bataillon de la garde autrichienne.jpg|thumb|right|Austrian Guard Company on parade - July 14th 2007, [[Champs Elysées]], [[Paris]].]]
{{main|Military of Austria}}
The manpower of the Austrian Armed Forces (&quot;Bundesheer&quot;) mainly relies on [[conscription]]. All males who have reached the age of eighteen and are found fit get recruited for a six months long [[military service]], which can be postponed under some circumstances. [[Conscientious objector|Conscientious objection]] is legally possible and obliges to serve an institutionalized nine months [[Zivildienst|civilian service]] instead. Since 1998, women volunteers have been allowed to become professional soldiers.

The main sectors of the Bundesheer are Joint Forces (Streitkräfteführungskommando, SKFüKdo) which consist of Land Forces (Landstreitkräfte) , Air Forces (Luftstreitkräfte) , International Missions (Internationale Einsätze) , and Special Forces (Spezialeinsatzkräfte) ; next to Mission Support (Kommando Einsatzunterstützung; KdoEU) and Command Support (Kommando Führungsunterstützung; KdoFüU). Being a [[landlocked country]], Austria has no [[navy]].

In 2004, Austria's defense expenditures corresponded to approximately 0.9% of its GDP. The Army currently has about 45,000 soldiers, of which about half are conscripts. As head of state, [[President of Austria|Austrian President]] (currently [[Heinz Fischer]]) is nominally the Commander-in-Chief of the Bundesheer. In practical reality, however, command of the Austrian Armed Forces is almost exclusively exercised by the Minister of Defense, currently [[Norbert Darabos]].

Since the end of the [[Cold War]], and more importantly the removal of the former heavily guarded &quot;[[Iron Curtain]]&quot; separating Austria and Hungary, the Austrian military has been assisting Austrian border guards in trying to prevent border crossings by illegal immigrants. This assistance came to an end when Hungary joined the EU Schengen area in 2008, for all intents and purposes abolishing &quot;internal&quot; border controls between treaty states. Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergencies, such as in the wake of natural disasters etc. They may generally not be used as auxiliary police forces.

Despite, or perhaps because of, its self-declared status of permanent neutrality, Austria has a long and proud tradition of engaging in UN-led peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions. The [[Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit]] (AFDRU) , in particular, an all-volunteer unit with close ties to civilian specialists (rescue dog handlers, etc) enjoys a reputation as a quick (standard deployment time is 10 hours) and efficient [[Search and rescue|SAR]] unit. Currently, larger contingents of Austrian forces are deployed in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]] and, since 1974, in the [[Golan Heights]].

==States==
{{main|States of Austria}}
As a [[federal republic]], Austria is divided into [[States of Austria|nine states]] ({{lang-de|''Bundesländer''}}). These states are then divided into [[district]]s ({{lang|de|''[[Bezirke]]''}}) and cities ({{lang|de|''[[Statutarstadt|Statutarstädte]]''}}). Districts are subdivided into municipalities ({{lang|de|''Gemeinden''}}). Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. The states are not mere administrative divisions but have some distinct legislative authority separate from the federal government.

==Geography==
[[Image:Oesterreich topo.png|thumb|left|240px|Topography of Austria]]
{{main|Geography of Austria}}
Austria is a largely [[mountain]]ous country due to its location in the [[Alps]]. The [[Central Eastern Alps]], [[Northern Limestone Alps]] and [[Southern Limestone Alps]] are all partly in Austria. Of the total area of Austria (84&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km² or 32,000&amp;nbsp;[[square mile|sq. mi]]) , only about a quarter can be considered low lying, and only 32% of the country is below 500 meters (1,640&amp;nbsp;ft). The high mountainous Alps in the west of Austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country.

[[Image:Schröcken2.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Austrian countryside of [[Schröcken]].]]
Austria can be divided into five areas. The biggest area are the [[Eastern Alps|Austrian Alps]], which constitute 62% of Austria's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the [[Alps]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] account for around 12% of its area. The foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north. Known as the Austrian [[granite]] [[plateau]], it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass, and accounts for 10% of Austria. The Austrian portion of the [[Vienna basin]] comprises the remaining 4%.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Austria belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Austria can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Central European mixed forests]], [[Pannonian mixed forests]], [[Alps conifer and mixed forests]] and [[Western European broadleaf forests]].

==Climate==
The greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate [[climate zone]] in which humid westerly winds predominate. With over half of the country dominated by the [[Alps]] the [[alpine climate]] is the predominant one. In the East, in the [[Pannonian Plain]] and along the [[Danube|Danube valley]], the climate shows continental features with less rain than the alpine areas. Although Austria is cold in the winter, in the summer temperatures can be relatively warm reaching 20-35 degrees Celsius.

The six highest mountains in Austria are:

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Austria}}
{{seealso|List of Austrian companies}}
[[Image:T-mobil center wien.jpg|thumb|Modern Vienna]]
Austria is one of the 10 richest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita, has a well-developed [[social market economy]], and a very high [[standard of living]]. Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, [[Privatization|privatisation]] has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. [[Labour movement]]s are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics. Next to a highly-developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the national economy.

[[Germany]] has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the [[German economy]]. But since Austria became a member state of the [[European Union]] it has gained closer ties to other [[European Union]] economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market and proximity to EU aspiring economies. Growth in GDP accelerated in recent years and reached 3.3% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oenb.at/isaweb/report.do?&amp;lang=EN&amp;report=7.7 Real GDP Growth – Expenditure Side], provided by the Austrian National Bank {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numismatics==
[[Image:Austria 100 Euro Vienna Philharmonic front.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#Vienna Philharmonic Coin|The €100 Vienna Philharmonic commemorative coin]] minted every year.]]
{{main|Austrian euro coins}}
{{main|Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)}}

In Austria, the [[euro]] was introduced in 2002. As a preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 1999, however all Austrian euro coins introduced in 2002 have this year on it; unlike other countries of the [[Eurozone]] where mint year is minted in the coin.  Eight different designs, one per face value, was selected for the Austrian coins. In 2007, in order to adopt the new common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries, Austria changed the common side of their coins.

Austria has one of the richest collection of collectors' coins in the Eurozone, with face value ranging from 10 to 100 euro (although a 100,000 euro coin was exceptionally minted in 2004).  These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting of silver and gold commemorative coins.  Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the eurozone. For instance, a €5 Austrian commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country.

==Education==
{{main|Education in Austria}}
Responsibility for educational oversight in Austria is entrusted partly to the Austrian [[states]] (Bundesländer), and partly to the federal government. Optional [[kindergarten]] education is provided for all children between the ages of three and six years. School attendance is [[Compulsory education|compulsory]] for nine years, i.e. usually to the age of fifteen. The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[OECD]], currently ranks Austria's education as the 18th best in the world, being significantly higher than the OECD average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primary education]] lasts for four years. Alongside [[Germany]], [[secondary education]] includes two main types of schools based on a pupil's ability as determined by grades from the primary school: the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] for the more gifted children which normally leads to the [[Matura]] which is a requirement for access to universities and the [[Hauptschule]] which prepares pupils for vocational education but also for further education ([[HTL]] = institution of higher technical education; [[HAK]] = commercial academy; [[HBLA]] = institution of higher education for economic business; etc.), where you also get the [[Matura]]. 

The Austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the [[Matura]] examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as [[Medicine]]. Currently all EU students are charged a fee of about €370 per semester for all university studies. A recent [[OECD]] report criticized the Austrian education system for the low number of students attending universities and the overall low number of academics compared to other OECD countries.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Canaletto (I) 058.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A painting by [[Canaletto]] of [[Vienna]] during the first half of the eighteenth century.]]
{{main|Demographics of Austria}}
Austria's population estimate in October 2006 was 8,292,322. The population of the capital, [[Vienna]], exceeds 1.6 million (2.2 million with suburbs) , representing about a quarter of the country's population and is known for its vast cultural offerings and high standard of living.

In contrast to the capital, other cities do not exceed 1 million inhabitants: the second largest city [[Graz]] is home to 250,099 inhabitants, followed by [[Linz]] (188,968), [[Salzburg]] (150,000), and [[Innsbruck]] (117,346). All other cities have fewer than 100,000 inhabitants.

German-speaking, by far the country's largest group, form roughly 90% of Austria's population. The Austrian federal states of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria (state)|Styria]] are home to a significant indigenous [[Carinthian Slovenes|Slovene speaking minority]] with around 14,000 members (Austrian census; unofficial numbers of Slovene groups speak of up to 50,000). In the east-most Bundesland, [[Burgenland]] (formerly part of the Hungarian half of [[Austria-Hungary]]) about 20,000 Austrian citizens speak [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and 30,000 speak [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Of the remaining [[number]] of Austria's people that are of non-Austrian descent, many come from surrounding countries, especially from the former [[Eastern Bloc|East Bloc]] nations. So-called [[foreign worker|guest workers]] ''(Gastarbeiter) '' and their descendants, as well as refugees from [[Yugoslav wars]] and other conflicts, also form an important [[minority group]] in Austria. Since 1994 the [[Romani people|Roma]]-[[Sinti]] (gypsies) are an officially recognized ethnic minority in Austria.

According to [[census]] information published by Statistik Austria for the year 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.statistik.at/web_de/static/bevoelkerung_2001_nach_umgangssprache_staatsangehoerigkeit_und_geburtsland_022896.pdf {{lang|de|Statistik Austria, Die Bevölkerung nach Umgangssprache, Staatsangehörigkei und Geburtsland}}]|41.3&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were a total of 710,926 foreign nationals living in Austria. Of these, 124,392 speak German as their mother tongue (mainly immigrants from Germany, some from Switzerland and [[Province of Bolzano-Bozen|Bolzano-Bozen]] (Italy).) The next largest populations of linguistic and ethnic groups are 240,863 foreign nationals from the former Yugoslavia (Serbian being the largest number of these at 135,376, followed by Croatian at 105,487); 123,417 Turkish nationals; 25,155 whose native tongue is English; 24,446 Albanian; 17,899 Polish; 14,699 Hungarian; 12,216 Romanian; 7,982 Arabs; 6,902 Slovenes (not including the autochthonous minority); 6,891 Slovaks; 6,707 Czech; 5,916 Persian; 5,677 Italian; 5,466 Russian; 5,213 French; 4,938 Chinese; 4,264 Spanish; 3,503 Bulgarian. The populations of the rest fall off sharply below 3,000.

The mother tongue of the population by prevalence, is German (88.6%) followed by Turkish (2.3%) , Serbian (2.2%) , Croatian (1.6%) , Hungarian (0.5%) and Bosnian (0.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[ftp://www.statistik.at/pub/neuerscheinungen/vzaustriaweb.pdf {{lang|de|Statistik Austria, Die Bevölkerung nach Umgangssprache, Staatsangehörigkei und Geburtsland}}, page 75. ]}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official language, [[German language|German]], is spoken by almost all residents of the country. Austria's mountainous terrain led to the development of many distinct German dialects. All of the dialects in the [[country]], however, belong to [[Austro-Bavarian]] groups of German dialects, with the exception of the dialect spoken in its western-most Bundesland, [[Vorarlberg]], which belongs to the group of [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialects. There is also a distinct grammatical standard for [[Austrian German]] with a few differences to the German spoken in Germany.

As of 2006, some of the Austrian states introduced standardised tests for new citizens, to assure their language ability, cultural knowledge and accordingly their ability to integrate into the Austrian society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wien.at/verwaltung/personenwesen/staatsbuergerschaft/allgem.html Requirements to become an Austrian citizen], provided by the Viennese state government {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics concerning ethnic groups ({{lang|de|''Volksgruppenpolitik''}})===
An estimated 13,000 to 40,000 [[Slovenes]] in the Austrian state of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] (the [[Carinthian Slovenes]]) as well as [[Croats]] (around 30,000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croates.at/haupt/gesch_fr.htm HKDC Geschichte - Frame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hungarians]] in Burgenland were recognized as a minority and have enjoyed special rights following the Austrian State Treaty ({{lang|de|''Staatsvertrag''}}) of 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 153&quot;/&gt; The Slovenes in the Austrian state of [[Styria (state)|Styria]] (estimated at a number between 1,600 and 5,000) are not recognized as a minority and do not enjoy special rights, although the State Treaty of July 27, 1955 states otherwise.

The right for bilingual topographic signs for the regions where Slovene- and Croat-Austrians live alongside the Germanic population (as required by the 1955 State Treaty) is still to be fully implemented. Many Carinthians are afraid of [[Slovenia]]n territorial claims, pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two World Wars and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The current governor, [[Jörg Haider]], has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the Kärntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view. Another interesting phenomenon is the so called &quot;Windischen-Theorie&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windischen-Theorie&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the Slovenes can be split in two groups: actual Slovenes and ''Windische'' (a traditional German name for Slavs), based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenes, who were taught Slovene standard language in school and those Slovenes who spoke their local Slovene dialect but went to German schools. The term ''Windische'' was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction. This theory was never generally accepted and fell out of use some decades ago.

At the end of the twentieth century, about 74% of Austria's population were registered as Roman Catholic,&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Census 2001: Population 2001 according to religious affiliation and nationality|url=http://www.statistik.at/web_de/static/bevoelkerung_2001_nach_religionsbekenntnis_und_staatsangehoerigkeit_022894.pdf|accessmonthday=December 17|accessyear=2007|language=German|publisher=Statistik Austria|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; while about 5% considered themselves [[Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot;/&gt; Both these numbers have been in decline for decades, especially Roman Catholicism, which has suffered an increasing number of seceders from the church.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} Austrian Catholics are obliged to pay a mandatory tax (calculated by income —about 1%) to the Austrian Roman Catholic Church, which might (have) act(ed) as an incentive to leave the church.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

About 12% of the population declare that they have [[irreligion|no religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot;/&gt; Of the remaining people, around 340,000 are registered as members of various Muslim communities, mainly due to the influx from [[Turkey]], furthermore [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Albania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot;/&gt; About 180,000 are members of [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, more than 20.000 are active [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchtower.org/statistics/worldwide_report.htm Statistics: 2005 Report of Jehovah's Witnesses Worldwide].&lt;/ref&gt; and about 8,100 are [[Judaism|Jewish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot;/&gt; The Austrian Jewish Community of 1938 – Vienna alone counted more than 200,000 - was reduced to solely 4,000 to 5,000 after the [[World War II|Second World War]], with approximately 65,000 Austrian Jews killed in [[the Holocaust]] and 130,000 emigrating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wien.gv.at/english/culture/jewishvienna/history/nationalsocialism.html Expulsion, Deportation and Murder - History of the Jews in Vienna] Vienna Webservice&lt;/ref&gt; A significant proportions of the current Jewish population are post-war immigrants, particularly from eastern Europe and central Asia (including  [[Bukharian Jew]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjews.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=212 Bukharian Jews find homes on Long Island], ''Bukharian Reviews'', September 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism in Austria|Buddhism]], which was legally recognized as a religion in Austria in 1983 has a following of 20,000 (10,402 at the 2001 [[census]]).{{fact|date=December 2007}}

* '''54%''' of Austrian citizens responded that &lt;font color=&quot;#884400&quot;&gt;''&quot;they believe there is a God&quot;''&lt;/font&gt;.
* '''34%''' answered that &lt;font color=&quot;#884400&quot;&gt;''&quot;they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force&quot;''&lt;/font&gt;.

While northern and central Germany was the origin of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Austria (and Bavaria) was the heart of the [[Counter-Reformation]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the absolute monarchy of [[Habsburg]] imposed a strict regime to maintain Catholicism's power and influence among Austrians.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 16&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Habsburg]]s viewed themselves as the vanguard of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and all other confessions and religions were repressed. In 1781, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] issued a Patent of Tolerance that allowed other Christian confessions a limited [[freedom of religion|freedom of worship]]. Religious freedom was declared a constitutional right in the Austro-Hungarian ''[[Ausgleich]]'' in 1867 thus paying tribute to the fact that the monarchy was home of numerous religions beside Roman Catholicism such as Greek, Serbian, Romanian, Russian, and Bulgarian [[Orthodox Christians]] (Austria neighboured the [[Ottoman Empire]] for centuries) , and both [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]].

Austria continued to remain largely influenced by Catholicism. After 1918, First Republic Catholic leaders such as [[Theodor Innitzer]] and [[Ignaz Seipel]] took leading positions within or close to Austria's government and increased their influence during the time of the [[Austrofascism]]; —Catholicism was treated much like a [[state religion]] by [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]].{{Fact|date=November 2007}} Although Catholic leaders initially welcomed the Germans{{fact|date=January 2008}} in 1938 during the [[Anschluss]] of Austria into [[Germany]], Austrian Catholicism stopped its support of [[Nazism]] later on and many former religious public figures became involved with the resistance during the [[Third Reich]]. After the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, a stricter secularism was imposed in Austria, and religious influence on politics declined.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

Austria's past as a European power and its cultural environment have generated a broad contribution to various forms of art, most notably among them music. Austria has been the birthplace of many [[Music of Austria|famous composers]] such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss, Sr.]], [[Johann Strauss, Jr.]] and [[Gustav Mahler]] as well as members of the [[Second Viennese School]] such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]].

Vienna has long been especially an important center of musical innovation. Eighteenth and nineteenth century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. During the Baroque period, Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music. Vienna's status began its rise as a cultural center in the early 1500s, and was focused around instruments including the lute. [[Beethoven|Ludwig van Beethoven]] spent the better part of his life in Vienna.

Austria's current [[national anthem]], attributed to Mozart, was chosen after [[World War II]] to replace the traditional Austrian anthem by Joseph Haydn.

Austria has also produced one notable jazz musician, keyboardist [[Josef Zawinul]] who helped pioneer electronic influences in jazz as well as being a notable composer in his own right. [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] was an internationally acclaimed [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] musician.

===Science, philosophy and economics===

Austria was the cradle of numerous scientists with international reputations. Among them are [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Victor Franz Hess]] and [[Christian Doppler]], prominent scientists in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, contributions by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] to nuclear research and quantum mechanics were key to these areas' development during the 1920s and 1930s. A present-day quantum physicist is [[Anton Zeilinger]], noted as the first scientist to demonstrate [[quantum teleportation]].

In addition to physicists, Austria was the birthplace of two of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]]. In addition to them biologists [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] as well as mathematician [[Kurt Gödel]] and engineers such as [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Siegfried Marcus]] were Austrians.

A focus of Austrian science has always been medicine and psychology, starting in medieval times with [[Paracelsus]]. Eminent physicians like [[Theodore Billroth]], [[Clemens von Pirquet]], and [[Anton Eiselsberg|Anton von Eiselsberg]] have built upon the achievements of the 19th century [[Vienna School|Vienna School of Medicine]]. Austria was home to psychologists [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Hans Asperger]] and psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]].

The [[Austrian School]] of Economics, which is prominent as one of the main competitive directions for economic theory, is related to Austrian economists [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]].

Other noteworthy Austrian-born émigrés include the management thinker [[Peter Drucker]] and the 38th Governor of California, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

===Literature===
{{seealso|List of Austrian writers|Austrian literature}}
Complementing its status as a land of artists and scientists, Austria has always been a country of poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], [[Franz Kafka]], and [[Robert Musil]], of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], and [[Adalbert Stifter]], and of writer [[Karl Kraus]].

Famous contemporary playwrights and novelists are Nobel prize winner [[Elfriede Jelinek]] and writer [[Peter Handke]].

===Cuisine===
{{main|Cuisine of Austria}}
[[Image:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Wiener Schnitzel]].]]
Austria's cuisine is derived from the cuisine of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. In addition to native regional traditions, it has been influenced above all by [[Hungary|Hungarian]], [[Czech republic|Czech]], [[Jewish]], [[Italy|Italian]] and Bavarian cuisines, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. The Austrian Cuisine is therefore one of the most multi and transcultural cuisines in Europe.

Typical Austrian dishes include [[Wiener Schnitzel]], [[Schweinsbraten]], [[Kaiserschmarren]], [[Knödel]], [[Sachertorte]] and [[Tafelspitz]]. There are also Kasnockn, a macaroni dish with fresh Pinzgauer cheese and parsley, and Eierschwammerl ([[Cantharellus|chanterelle]]) dishes. The Eierschwammerl are the native yellow, tan mushrooms. These mushrooms are delicious, especially when in a thick Austrian soup, or on regular meals.

The candy [[PEZ]] was invented in Austria. Austria is also famous for its [[Apfelstrudel]].

===Sports===
[[Image:STANTON2.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Skiing slopes at [[Sankt Anton am Arlberg]]]]
The most popular sport in Austria is [[alpine skiing]] and Austria shows constant dominance in the Nations-Cup. Similar sports such as [[snowboarding]] or [[ski-jumping]] are also widely popular.
The most popular team sport in Austria is [[Association football|football]]. However, Austria rarely has international success in this discipline, going out in the first round of the [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship]] which was co-hosted with Switzerland. Besides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports including [[Austrian Hockey League|ice hockey]] and [[basketball]]. [[Bobsleigh]], [[luge]], and [[skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] are also popular events with a permanent track located in [[Igls bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track|Igls]], which hosted bobsleigh and luge competitions for the [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and [[1976 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Innsbruck]].
