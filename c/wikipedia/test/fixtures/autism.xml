'''Autism''' is a [[Neurodevelopmental disorders|brain development disorder]] that is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior, all starting before a child is three years old. This set of signs distinguishes autism from milder [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD) such as [[pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS).&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00/&gt;

Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the [[Heritability of autism|genetics of autism]] are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt; In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with [[Teratology|agents that cause birth defects]].&lt;ref name=Arndt/&gt; Other proposed [[Causes of autism|causes]], such as childhood [[vaccine]]s, are [[Controversies in autism|controversial]]; the vaccine hypotheses lack convincing scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt; Most recent reviews estimate a [[prevalence]] of one to two cases per 1,000 people for autism, and about six per 1,000 for ASD, with ASD averaging a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio. The number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, at least partly as a result of changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

Autism affects many parts of the [[Human brain|brain]]; how this occurs is not understood. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. Early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help children gain self-care, social, and communication skills. There is no known cure.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; Few children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, but some become successful,&lt;ref name=Howlin/&gt; and an [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic culture]] has developed, with some seeking a cure and others believing that autism is a condition rather than a disorder.&lt;ref name=Rajendran/&gt;

==Classification==
Autism is a brain development disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; Impairments result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.&lt;ref name=Penn/&gt; Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt;

[[Image:Asperger kl2.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Asperger]] introduced the modern sense of the word ''autism'' in 1938.&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt;]]
Of the other four PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lord C, Cook EH, Leventhal BL, Amaral DG |title= Autism spectrum disorders |journal=Neuron |volume=28 |issue=2 |date=2000 |pages=355–63 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)00115-X |pmid=11144346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike autism, Asperger's has no substantial delay in [[language development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author= [[American Psychiatric Association]] |date=2000 |isbn=0890420254 |chapter= Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder |chapterurl=http://www.mindsite.com/dsm_iv/asperger_s_disorder#diagnostic_criteria}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger's and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',&lt;ref name=Freitag&gt;{{cite journal |author=Freitag CM |title= The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature |journal= Mol Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |date=2007 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 |pmid=17033636}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'', ''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''. In this article, ''autism'' refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, ''autism'', ''ASD'', and ''PDD'' are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism [[phenotype]] (BAP), which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like [[Trait (biology)|traits]], such as avoiding eye contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Piven J, Palmer P, Jacobi D, Childress D, Arndt S |title= Broader autism phenotype: evidence from a family history study of multiple-incidence autism families |journal= Am J Psychiatry |date=1997 |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=185–90 |pmid=9016266 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/154/2/185.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifestations of autism cover a wide [[Spectrum disorder|spectrum]], ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, [[mentally disabled]], and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to less impaired individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Happé F |title= Understanding assets and deficits in autism: why success is more interesting than failure |journal=Psychologist |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=540–7 |date=1999 |url=http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- and [[high-functioning autism]] (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on [[IQ]] thresholds,&lt;ref name=hypersystem/&gt; or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial. Autism can also be divided into [[syndrome|syndromal]] and non-syndromal autism, where the former is associated with severe or profound [[mental retardation]] or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as [[tuberous sclerosis]].&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |date=2005 |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=103–16 |title= Specific genetic disorders and autism: clinical contribution towards their identification |author= Cohen D, Pichard N, Tordjman S ''et al.'' |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-1038-2 |pmid=15796126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although individuals with Asperger's tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the [[Diagnosis of Asperger syndrome#Differences from high-functioning autism|overlap between Asperger's, HFA, and non-syndromal autism]] is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Validity of ASD subtypes:

Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills after 14 months of age, as opposed to a failure to make progress. Several terms are used for this phenomenon, including [[regressive autism]], setback autism, and developmental stagnation. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype.&lt;ref name=Landa3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Landa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Volkmar&gt;{{cite journal |author= Volkmar F, Chawarska K, Klin A |title= Autism in infancy and early childhood |journal= Annu Rev Psychol |date=2005 |volume=56 |pages=315–36 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070159 |pmid=15709938}} A partial update is in: {{cite journal |journal= World Psychiatry |date=2008 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=19–21 |title= Autism in infants: an update |author= Volkmar FR, Chawarska K |pmid=18458791 |pmc=2366821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inability to identify biologically meaningful subpopulations has hampered research into causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=2008 |volume=121 |issue=6 |pages=1225–9 |title= Autism and the environment: challenges and opportunities for research |author= Altevogt BM, Hanson SL, Leshner AI |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-3000 |pmid=18519493}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior, with the name ''Type 1 autism'' denoting rare autism cases that test positive for a mutation in the gene [[contactin associated protein-like 2]] (CNTNAP2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Am J Hum Genet |date=2008 |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=7–9 |title= Unraveling autism |author= Stephan DA |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.12.003 |pmid=18179879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Autism is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than one single symptom. The main characteristics are impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt; Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathological severity from common traits.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

===Social development===
People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the social communication of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with normal neural development, as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]: Seven Paradoxical Tales|author=[[Oliver Sacks|Sacks O]]|publisher=Knopf|date=1995|isbn=0679437851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social impairments become apparent early in childhood and continue through adulthood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers have more striking social deviance; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and anticipatory postures and are more likely to communicate by manipulating another person's hand.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev|date=2004|volume=10|issue=4|pages=221–33|title=Early detection of core deficits in autism|author=Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A|doi=10.1002/mrdd.20046|pmid=15666338}}&lt;/ref&gt; They display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than usual, although this feature disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry|date=2004|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1123–34|title=Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review|author=Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van IJzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x|pmid=15257669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition.&lt;ref name=Sigman&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Annu Rev Clin Psychol |year=2006 |volume=2 |pages=327–55 |title= Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives |author= Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT |doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 |pmid=17716073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to common belief, autistic children do not prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they are.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that in children with mental retardation, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and tantrums. Dominick ''et al.'' interviewed the parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in children with a history of language impairment.&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt; A 2008 Swedish study found that, of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD, those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Interpers Violence |year=2008 |title= Risk factors for violent offending in autism spectrum disorder: a national study of hospitalized individuals |author= Långström N, Grann M, Ruchkin V, Sjöstedt G, Fazel S |doi=10.1177/0886260508322195 |pmid=18701743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Intellect Disabil Res |date=2006 |volume=50 |issue=9 |pages=621–32 |title= The ComFor: an instrument for the indication of augmentative communication in people with autism and intellectual disability |author= Noens I, van Berckelaer-Onnes I, Verpoorten R, van Duijn G |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00807.x |pmid=16901289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [[babbling]], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and the desynchronization of vocal patterns with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([[echolalia]])&lt;ref name=Landa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; or [[Pronoun reversal|reverse pronouns]].&lt;ref name=Kanner1943/&gt; [[Joint attention]] seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD:&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.&lt;ref name=Landa&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |date=2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |title= Early communication development and intervention for children with autism |author= Landa R |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20134 |pmid=17326115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Pediatr Clin North Am |year=2007 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=469–81 |title= Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders |author= Tager-Flusberg H, Caronna E |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.011 |pmid=17543905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well, and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===
[[Image:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|A young boy with autism, and the precise line of toys he made]]
Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)&lt;ref name=RBS-R/&gt; categorizes as follows.
*'''[[Stereotypy]]''' is apparently purposeless movement, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
*'''[[Compulsive behavior]]''' is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in a certain way.
*'''Sameness''' is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
*'''[[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]''' involves the performance of daily activities the same way each time, such as an unvarying menu or dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |date=2007 |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=855–66 |title= The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders |author= Lam KSL, Aman MG |doi=10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z |pmid=17048092 |url=http://springerlink.com/content/v03747x60562638m/fulltext.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Restricted behavior''' is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program.
*'''[[Self-injury]]''' includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as biting oneself. Dominick ''et al.'' reported that self-injury at some point affected about 30% of children with ASD.&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt;
No single repetitive behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.&lt;ref name=RBS-R&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |date=2000 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=237–43 |title= Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation |author= Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH |doi=10.1023/A:1005596502855 |pmid=11055459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other symptoms===
Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.&lt;ref name=Filipek&gt;{{cite journal |author= Filipek PA, Accardo PJ, Baranek GT ''et al.'' |title= The screening and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |date=1999 |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=439–84 |doi=10.1023/A:1021943802493}} {{cite journal |title=Erratum |quotes=no |date=2000 |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=81 |doi=10.1023/A:1017256313409 |pmid=10638459}} This paper represents a consensus of representatives from nine professional and four parent organizations in the U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious [[Savant syndrome|autistic savant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Treffert DA |title= Savant syndrome: an extraordinary condition—a synopsis: past, present, future |publisher= Wisconsin Medical Society |date=2006 |url=http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant_syndrome/overview_of_savant_syndrome/synopsis |accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual responses to [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensory stimuli]] are more common and prominent in autistic children, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry|date=2005|volume=46|issue=12|pages=1255–68|title=Annotation: what do we know about sensory dysfunction in autism?

Several studies have reported associated motor problems that include [[poor muscle tone]], [[Apraxia|poor motor planning]], and [[toe walking]]; ASD is not associated with severe motor disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Brain Dev |date=2007 |volume=29 |issue=9 |pages=565–70 |title= Prevalence of motor impairment in autism spectrum disorders |author= Ming X, Brimacombe M, Wagner GC |doi=10.1016/j.braindev.2007.03.002 |pmid=17467940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atypical eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur;&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt; this does not appear to result in [[malnutrition]]. Although some children with autism also have [[gastrointestinal]] (GI) symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|date=2005|volume=35|issue=6|pages=713–27|title=Gastrointestinal factors in autistic disorder: a critical review|author=Erickson CA, Stigler KA, Corkins MR, Posey DJ, Fitzgerald JF, McDougle CJ|doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0019-4|pmid=16267642}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between GI problems and ASD is unclear.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt;

[[Sleep]] problems are known to be more common in children with developmental disabilities, and there is some evidence that children with ASD are more likely to have even more sleep problems than those with other developmental disabilities; autistic children may experience problems including difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal [[Wakefulness|awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. Dominick ''et al.'' found that about two-thirds of children with ASD had a history of sleep problems.&lt;ref name=Dominick&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Res Dev Disabil|year=2007|volume=28|issue=2|pages=145–62|title=Atypical behaviors in children with autism and children with a history of language impairment|author=Dominick KC, Davis NO, Lainhart J, Tager-Flusberg H, Folstein S|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2006.02.003|pmid=16581226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=2007 |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages=e1040–6 |title= Psychological functioning and coping among mothers of children with autism: a population-based study |author= Montes G, Halterman JS |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-2819 |pmid=17473077 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/119/5/e1040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |date=2007 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=313–20 |title= Siblings of individuals with autism spectrum disorders across the life course |author= Orsmond GI, Seltzer MM |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20171 |pmid=17979200 |url=http://waisman.wisc.edu/family/pdf/MRDDRR-OrsmondSeltzer2007.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{main|Causes of autism}}
[[Image:Single Chromosome Mutations.png|thumb|left|Deletion (1), duplication (2) and inversion (3) are all [[chromosome abnormalities]] that have been implicated in autism.&lt;ref name=Beaudet/&gt;]]
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the [[Heritability of autism|genetics of autism]] are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare [[mutation]]s with major effects.&lt;ref name=Abrahams&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Nat Rev Genet |year=2008 |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=341–55 |title= Advances in autism genetics: on the threshold of a new neurobiology |author= Abrahams BS, Geschwind DH |doi=10.1038/nrg2346 |pmid=18414403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies of twins estimated [[heritability]] explains more than 90% of the risk of autism, assuming a shared environment and no other genetic or medical syndromes.&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified.

All known [[teratogen]]s (agents that cause [[birth defect]]s) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]], and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.&lt;ref name=Arndt&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Int J Dev Neurosci |date=2005 |volume=23 |issue=2–3 |pages=189–99 |title= The teratology of autism |author= Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM |doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001 |pmid=15749245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies,&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt; extensive searches are underway.&lt;ref name=Szpir&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Environ Health Perspect |date=2006 |volume=114 |issue=7 |pages=A412–8 |title= Tracing the origins of autism: a spectrum of new studies |author= Szpir M |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2006/114-7/focus.html |pmid=16835042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism, or may be important in future research, include certain foods, [[infectious disease]], [[heavy metals]], [[solvent]]s, [[diesel exhaust]], [[PCBs]], [[phthalates]] and [[phenol]]s used in [[plastic]] products, [[pesticide]]s, [[brominated flame retardant]]s, [[Ethanol|alcohol]], [[smoking]], [[illicit drug]]s, [[vaccine]]s,&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt; and [[prenatal stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Neurosci Biobehav Rev |date=2008 |title= Prenatal stress and risk for autism |author= Kinney DK, Munir KM, Crowley DJ, Miller AM |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.06.004 |pmid=18598714 |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=1519–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination, and parental concern about vaccines has led to a decreasing uptake of [[childhood immunizations]] and an increasing likelihood of [[Measles#Public health|measles outbreaks]], there is overwhelming scientific evidence showing no causal association between the [[MMR vaccine controversy|measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism]], and there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine preservative [[Thiomersal controversy|thiomersal helps cause autism]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaccines and autism:

==Mechanism==
Despite extensive investigation, how autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the [[pathophysiology]] of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the [[neuropsychological]] linkages between brain structures and behaviors.&lt;ref name=Penn&gt;{{cite journal |author= Penn HE |title= Neurobiological correlates of autism: a review of recent research |journal= Child Neuropsychol |date=2006 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=57–79 |doi=10.1080/09297040500253546 |pmid=16484102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

Interactions between the [[immune system]] and the nervous system begin early during [[embryogenesis]], and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. Several symptoms consistent with a poorly regulated immune response have been reported in autistic children. It is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Leukoc Biol |date=2006 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |title= The immune response in autism: a new frontier for autism research |author= Ashwood P, Wills S, Van de Water J |doi=10.1189/jlb.1205707 |pmid=16698940 |url=http://www.jleukbio.org/cgi/content/full/80/1/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[autoantibodies]] have not been associated with pathology, are found in diseases other than ASD, and are not always present in ASD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci |year=2007 |volume=1107 |pages=79–91 |title= Autoantibodies in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) |author= Wills S, Cabanlit M, Bennett J, Ashwood P, Amaral D, Van de Water J |doi=10.1196/annals.1381.009 |pmid=17804535}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial.&lt;ref name=Schmitz&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol |date=2008 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=4–11 |title= The neuropathology of autism: where do we stand? |author= Schmitz C, Rezaie P |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2990.2007.00872.x |pmid=17971078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[neurotransmitter]] abnormalities have been detected in autism, notably increased blood levels of [[serotonin]].

The [[mirror neuron system]] (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal of the same species perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;MNS and autism:

In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the [[default mode network]], a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing, with intact connectivity of the [[task-positive network]], used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking. The two networks are not negatively correlated in people with autism, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of self-referential thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Broyd SJ, Demanuele C, Debener S, Helps SK, James CJ, Sonuga-Barke EJS |title= Default-mode brain dysfunction in mental disorders: a systematic review |journal= Neurosci Biobehav Rev |year=2008 |pmid=18824195 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 brain-imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the [[cingulate cortex]] which differs in individuals with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Neuron |date=2008 |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=463–73 |title= Self responses along cingulate cortex reveal quantitative neural phenotype for high-functioning autism |author= Chiu PH, Kayali MA, Kishida KT ''et al.'' |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.12.020 |pmid=18255038 |laysummary=http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/20167/ |laysource= Technol Rev |laydate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychology===
Two major categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition. Hyper-systemizing hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle internal events—but are less effective at [[Empathy|empathizing]] by handling events generated by other agents.&lt;ref name=hypersystem&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Simon Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen S]]|title=The hyper-systemizing, assortative mating theory of autism|journal=Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry|date=2006|volume=30|issue=5|pages=865–72|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.010|pmid=16519981}}&lt;/ref&gt; It extends the extreme male brain theory, which hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom [[EQ SQ theory|systemizing is better than empathizing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baron-Cohen S|title=The extreme male brain theory of autism|journal=Trends Cogn Sci|date=2002|volume=6|issue=6|pages=248–54|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01904-6|pmid=12039606}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn is related to the earlier [[theory of mind]], which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the [[Sally-Anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baron-Cohen S, Leslie AM, Frith U|title=Does the autistic child have a 'theory of mind'? |journal=Cognition |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=37–46 |year=1985 |doi=10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 |pmid=2934210 |url=http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~aleslie/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20&amp;%20Frith%201985.pdf |format = PDF | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is mapped well from the mirror neuron system theory of autism.&lt;ref name=Iacoboni/&gt;

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing. [[Executive dysfunction]] hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in [[working memory]], planning, [[Inhibition Theory|inhibition]], and other forms of executive function.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= O'Hearn K, Asato M, Ordaz S, Luna B |title= Neurodevelopment and executive function in autism |journal= Dev Psychopathol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=1103–32 |year=2008 |pmid=18838033 |doi=10.1017/S0954579408000527}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hill EL |title= Executive dysfunction in autism |journal= Trends Cogn Sci |year=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=26–32 |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2004.01.001 |pmid=14697400}}&lt;/ref&gt; a weakness is that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children.&lt;ref name=Sigman/&gt; [[Weak central coherence theory]] hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Happé F, Frith U |title= The weak coherence account: detail-focused cognitive style in autism spectrum disorders |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |date=2006 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=5–25 |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0039-0 |pmid=16450045}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and [[perceptual]] operations in autistic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Autism Dev Disord |date=2006 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=27–43 |title= Enhanced perceptual functioning in autism: an update, and eight principles of autistic perception |author= Mottron L, [[Michelle Dawson|Dawson M]], Soulières I, Hubert B, Burack J |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0040-7 |pmid=16453071}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.&lt;ref name=HappeTime&gt;{{cite journal |author= Happé F, Ronald A, [[Robert Plomin|Plomin R]] |title= Time to give up on a single explanation for autism |journal= Nat Neurosci |date=2006 |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=1218–20 |doi=10.1038/nn1770 |pmid=17001340}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.&lt;ref name=Rajendran&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Dev Rev |year=2007 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=224–60 |title= Cognitive theories of autism |author= Rajendran G, Mitchell P |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2007.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screening==
About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months.&lt;ref name=Landa3/&gt; As postponing treatment may affect long-term outcome, any of the following signs is reason to have a child evaluated by a specialist without delay:

*No [[gesture|gesturing]] (pointing, waving goodbye, etc.) by 12 months.
*No single words by 16 months.
*No two-word spontaneous phrases (other than instances of [[echolalia]]) by 24 months.
*Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt;

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The [[Childhood Autism Rating Scale]] (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions. A [[differential diagnosis]] for ASD at this stage might also consider [[mental retardation]], [[hearing impairment]], and a [[specific language impairment]]&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; such as [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Dev Med Child Neurol |year=2000 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=349–53 |title= Autistic regression and Landau-Kleffner syndrome: progress or confusion? |author= Mantovani JF |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2000.tb00104.x |pmid=10855658 |doi_brokendate= 2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.&lt;ref name=Landa3&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Nat Clin Pract Neurol |date=2008 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=138–47 |title= Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life |author= Landa RJ |doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0731 |pmid=18253102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.&lt;ref name=Dover&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Arch Dis Child |date=2007 |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=540–5 |title= How to diagnose autism |author= Dover CJ, Le Couteur A |doi=10.1136/adc.2005.086280 |pmid=17515625}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 U.S. study found the average age of first evaluation by a qualified professional was 48 months and of formal ASD diagnosis was 61 months, reflecting an average 13-month delay, all far above recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Dev Behav Pediatr |date=2006 |volume=27 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=S79–87 |title= Examination of the time between first evaluation and first autism spectrum diagnosis in a population-based sample |author= Wiggins LD, Baio J, Rice C |pmid=16685189 |doi= 10.1097/00004703-200604002-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clinical genetics]] evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Genet Med |date=2008 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=4–12 |title= Genetics evaluation for the etiologic diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders |author= Schaefer GB, Mendelsohn NJ |doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31815efdd7 |pmid=18197051 |laysummary=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php |laysource= Medical News Today |laydate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; consensus guidelines in the U.S. and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and [[fragile X]] testing.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; A [[genotype]]-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ledbetter DH |title= Cytogenetic technology—genotype and phenotype |journal= N Engl J Med |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2008 |pmid=18784093 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe0806570 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMe0806570}}&lt;/ref&gt; As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge.

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shattuck PT, Grosse SD|title=Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders|journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev|date=2007|volume=13|issue=2|pages=129–35|doi=10.1002/mrdd.20143|pmid=17563895}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research|author=Cass H|journal=Autism|date=1998|volume=2|issue=2|pages=117–38|doi=10.1177/1362361398022002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood but are occasionally missed. Adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= National Autistic Society |title= Diagnosis: how can it benefit me as an adult? |date=2005 |url=http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=8018 |accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:US-autism-6-11-1996-2005.png|thumb|left|Reports of autism cases grew dramatically in the U.S. from 1996 to 2005. It is unknown how much, if any, growth came from changes in autism's [[prevalence]].]]

The risk of autism is associated with several prenatal and [[perinatal]] risk factors. A 2007 review of [[risk factors]] found associated parental characteristics that included advanced maternal age, advanced paternal age, and maternal place of birth outside Europe or North America, and also found associated [[obstetric]] conditions that included low [[birth weight]] and [[gestation]] duration, and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] during [[childbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kolevzon A, Gross R, Reichenberg A |title= Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for autism |journal= Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=161 |issue=4 |date=2007 |pages=326–33 |pmid=17404128 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/161/4/326 |doi= 10.1001/archpedi.161.4.326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autism is associated with several other conditions:
*'''[[Genetic disorder]]s'''. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable [[Mendelian]] (single-gene) condition, [[chromosome abnormality]], or other genetic syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Folstein SE, Rosen-Sheidley B |title= Genetics of autism: complex aetiology for a heterogeneous disorder |journal= Nat Rev Genet |date=2001 |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=943–55 |doi=10.1038/35103559 |pmid=11733747}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Brain Dev |date=2007 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=257–72 |title= Childhood autism and associated comorbidities |author= Zafeiriou DI, Ververi A, Vargiami E |doi=10.1016/j.braindev.2006.09.003 |pmid=17084999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Mental retardation]]'''.

*'''[[Maleness]]'''. Boys are at higher risk for autism than girls. The ASD sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with mental retardation and more than 5.5:1 without.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

*Several '''[[metabolic defect]]s''', such as [[phenylketonuria]], are associated with autistic symptoms.&lt;ref name=Manzi&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Child Neurol |date=2008 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=307–14 |title= Autism and metabolic diseases |author= Manzi B, Loizzo AL, Giana G, Curatolo P |doi=10.1177/0883073807308698 |pmid=18079313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for [[ADHD]], [[Tourette syndrome]], and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Eur J Pediatr |date=2008 |title= What's new in autism? |author= Steyaert JG, De La Marche W |doi=10.1007/s00431-008-0764-4 |pmid=18597114 |volume=167 |issue=10 |pages=1091–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{See also|Sociological and cultural aspects of autism}}

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The ''[[table talk (literature)|Table Talk]]'' of [[Martin Luther]] contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Autism|volume=1|issue=1|pages=13–23|date=1997|doi=10.1177/1362361397011004|title=The history of ideas on autism: legends, myths and reality|author=[[Lorna Wing|Wing L]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Luther's notetaker [[Johannes Mathesius|Mathesius]], Luther thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh [[demonic possession|possessed by the devil]], and suggested that he be suffocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miles M|date=2005|title=Martin Luther and childhood disability in 16th century Germany: what did he write? what did he say?|publisher=Independent Living Institute|url=http://independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html|accessdate=2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wild Boy of Aveyron]], a [[feral child]] caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student [[Jean Itard]] treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry|date=2004|volume=13|issue=4|pages=201–8|title=The history of autism|author=Wolff S|doi=10.1007/s00787-004-0363-5|pmid=15365889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''autos'' (αὐτός, meaning ''self''), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kuhn R; tr. Cahn CH|title=Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology|journal=Hist Psychiatry|volume=15|issue=3|date=2004|pages=361–6|doi=10.1177/0957154X04044603|pmid=15386868}} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:kanner kl2.jpg|thumb|[[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]
The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology &quot;autistic psychopaths&quot; in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–7 |title= Das psychisch abnormale Kind |author= [[Hans Asperger|Asperger H]] |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating a form of ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=Kanner1943&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Leo Kanner|Kanner L]] |title= Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal= Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |date=1943}} {{cite journal |title=Reprint |quotes=no |date=1968 |journal= Acta Paedopsychiatr |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=100–36 |pmid=4880460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=HappeTime/&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=Lyons&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=2022–3 |title= Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism |author= Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3 |pmid=17922179 |url=http://springerlink.com/content/m55051670u35066p/fulltext.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like &quot;infantile schizophrenia&quot;, and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation during the mid-1900s led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;[[refrigerator mother]]s&quot;. Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Can J Psychiatry |date=2003 |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=503–5 |title= Modern views of autism |author= Fombonne E |pmid=14574825 |url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |author= [[Peter Szatmari|Szatmari P]], Jones MB |pages=157–78 |title= Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition = 2nd ed |editor= Volkmar FR |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0521549574}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD,&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; parents continue to feel [[social stigma]] in situations where their autistic children's behaviors are perceived negatively by others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2008 |title= Adult attitudes toward behaviors of a six-year-old boy with autism |author= Chambres P, Auxiette C, Vansingle C, Gil S |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0519-5 |pmid=18297387 |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=1320–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[primary care physician]]s and [[medical specialist]]s still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2005 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=323–30 |title= A survey of autism knowledge in a health care setting |author= Heidgerken AD, Geffken G, Modi A, Frakey L |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-3298-x |pmid=16119473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Internet]] has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Biever C |title= Web removes social barriers for those with autism |work= New Scientist |issue=2610 |date=2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism]] have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.&lt;ref name=Rajendran/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Harmon A |title= How about not 'curing' us, some autistics are pleading |date=2004-12-20 |work= New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html |accessdate=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
