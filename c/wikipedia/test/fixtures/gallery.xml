'''Graphics''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Graphikos {{lang|grc|[[:wiktionary:γραφικός|γραφικός]]}}) are [[visual]] presentations on some surface, such as a wall, [[canvas]], computer screen, paper, or stone. It includes everything that relates to creation of [[signs]], [[charts]], [[logos]], [[graphs]],[[drawings]], [[Line Art]], [[symbols]], [[geometric]] designs and so on. [[Graphic Design]] is the art or profession of combining text, pictures, and ideas in advertisements, publication, or website. The aim of graphic is to [[brand]], inform, and have a specific effect on its audience.&lt;ref&gt; see: Oxford Dictionary [http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/graphicdesign?view=uk], Merriam Webster Dictionary [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Graphic%20Design], and Random House Dictionary [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/graphic_design]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History of Graphics ==

Hundreds of graphic designs of animals by the primitive people in the [[Chauvet cave]], in the south of France,which were drawn more than 30,000 B.C. &lt;ref&gt; See: Chauvet, Jean-Marie; Eliette Brunel Deschamps, Christian Hillaire (1996). Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave. Paul G. Bahn (Foreword), Jean Clottes (Epilogue). New York: Harry N. Abrams. ISBN 0810932326&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as similar designs in the Lascaux cave of France that were drawn more than 14,000 B.C.&lt;ref&gt; see: The Cave of Lascaux, by Mario Ruspoli, Harry N. Abrams (May 1, 1987), ISBN-10: 0810912678, ISBN-13: 978-0810912670 &lt;/ref&gt;, or the designs of the primitive hunters in the rocks of Bhimbetka in India that were drawn more than 7,000 B.C. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This history together with the history of writing which was emerged in 3000-4000 B.C. are at the foundation of the Graphic Art.

=== Writing ===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:LantingXu.jpg| The ''Lantingji Xu'', Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion is the most famous work of Chinese calligrapher Wang Xizhi, created in year  353.  &lt;ref&gt;This calligraphy describes a gathering of 42 poets including  Xie An  and Sun Chuo at the Orchid Pavilion near Shaoxing, Zhejiang, during the Spring Purification Festival to compose poems and enjoy the wine. The poets had agreed to participate in a drinking contest: wine cups were floated down a small winding creek as the men sat along its banks; whenever a cup stopped, the man closest to the cup was required to drink it and write a poem. In the end, twenty-six of the participants composed thirty-seven poems.Richard Kurt Kraus, Brushes with Power (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== First use Graphics in Books - Arabesque ==

The religious books have used graphics extensively. Among these books are the [[Bibles]] that have been created in the monasteries in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[England]]. here are four examples. These graphics in these books have been influenced by the Arabesque. Muslims who, because of their religious beliefs, could not paint human bodies or animals, like Romans or Greeks, used geometrical and abstract designs to decorated the their holy books, and their mosques. Europeans were influenced by these designs.  &lt;ref&gt;See Larousse: [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/#larousse/763/102/arabesques]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Graphics in Quran ===
In Islamic countries the graphic designs can be found in their holy book Quran. The writers used black ink and golden paper to write with an angled alphabet, Called Kuffi. Such writings appeared in 8th century, and reached their apex in 1oth century. Later on decoration of margin, page and other graphic techniques added to beautify the book. In 12th century the Naskh alphabet was invented that instead of angled lines used curves. Other styles such as Mohaghegh, Reyhan, Sols, Reghaa, and Toghii was added later on  &lt;ref&gt;  :Drogin, Marc Medieval Calligraphy: Its History and Technique.

=== Calligraphy and graphics   ===
&lt;gallery&gt;
   
Image:Schriftzug Urkunde.jpg|Calligrapy has been considered with respect among all nations. By using beautiful and elegant penmanship various nations try to give an air of respectability and force to their official documents, agreements, and pacts. For example in this German Urkunde  the elegance of the calligraphy  communicates a message of importance.&lt;ref&gt; For history of calligraphy see: A History of Calligraphy، by Gaur, Albertine, and Guar, Cross River Press,1994, ISBN-13: 9781558598706, ISBN 1558598707، For Urkunde see:  Ludwig Fort: Deutsches Wechselbuch, oder praktischer Unterricht über die Wechselbriefe.

Image:Schedel register.jpg | Calligraphy adds a mystical dimension to a writing that is usually consistent with the feeling that a religious text tries to convey. This is why to create a spritual feeling many religious texts use calligraphy.

===  Graphics and Miniatures ===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:ParcAbbeyBibleFolio20rVirginChild.jpg|In this miniature painting of Mary and baby Jesus in Parc Abbey Bible of 12th century many of the principles of the modern graphic design is followed. The 13th century paintings with their bright and golden colors were influenced by the Byzantine art.

== Graphic Compositions in Asian Paintings: China, Japan, and Vietnam == 

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:SharakuTwoActors.jpg| In this wood print of the 18th century, a graphic work by the Japanese artist Toshusai Sharaku, a masterful composition in a one dimensional surface creates a powerful design. Japanese wood prints and painting style have influenced the design of modern posters through the works of artists like Toulouse Lautrec. &lt;ref&gt;Muneshige Narazaki, Sharaku:  The Enigmatic Ukiyo-e Master (Kodansha, Tokyo, 1983), Harold G.

Image:Ma Lin 001.jpg| The study of graphic design technique and the drawing style in this early 13th century work of the Chinese painter Ma Lin is revealing.  Notice that the perspective rules of proportionality is broken here. For example, the person in front of the picture is smaller than the person in the back. This is intended to show that the person in the back is of greater importance (perhaps he is a sage or a spiritual teacher), The composition of trees in the form of an X, which is centered on the main character, adds to his significance. These techniques are being used in the modern graphic design. &lt;ref&gt; See: Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting, By Richard Barnhart,Yale University Press; New edition edition (2 Aug 2002), ISBN-10: 0300094477, ISBN-13: 978-0300094473.

== Decorative Graphic Design in Pottery ==

From ancient times graphic design has been used for decoration of pottery and ceramics 
 
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Chalkidian Hyria Munich Inscription Painter 2.JPG| This Greek vase depicts a wrestling match between  Peleus and Atalanta in the funerary games of king Pelias. In the background, one can see the reward of the match which is the skin and the head of the Calydonian boar. Names inscriptions are written in the alphabet of Chalcis in Euboea. 550 BC. 

Image:SusaBeaker.jpg| This early Iranian made beaker created in Susa (modern Shush in Iran) which is now in  Louvre Museum of Paris, a bold,  minimalist and stylized graphic design  can be seen. On the rim of the beaker one can see long necked cranes, and beneath them there are racing hounds that simplified into hormonal streaks. The design of an ibex (a mountain goat) with few sweeping curves constitutes the main motive of this amazing design. (5000 BC) &lt;ref&gt; See: History of Art: The Western Tradition By Horst Woldemar Janson, Anthony F. Janson, Prentice Hall PTR, 2003, ISBN 0131828959, 9780131828957 and also  J.

Image:SialkJar.jpg| This large storage jar which is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York is a masterpiece of early pottery making in Iran. Produced in 4000 B.C. in a style known from excavations at the site of Tepe Sialk, it is a large buff-colored jar painted with dark brown designs. The geometric decoration on the upper portion of the vessel divides it into three panels. In each of these panels is the stylized image of an ibex shown in right profile, highlighting the great arch of its exaggerated horns.&lt;ref&gt; See:[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/02/wai/ho_59.52.htm The Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;   
Image:Halafpottery.jpg| In the period 6500–5500 B.C., the farming society of Halaf in northern Mesopotamia and Syria produced pottery that is among the finest ever made in the Near East. The Halaf potters used different sources of clay from their neighbors and achieved outstanding elaboration and elegance of design with their superior quality ware.   &lt;ref&gt; Campbell, Stuart. &quot;The Halaf Period in Iraq: Old Sites and New.&quot; Biblical Archaeologist 55 (1992), pp. 182–87.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Birth of the Modern Graphic Design ==
Perhaps it would be possible to consider William Morris the father of modern graphics. In the second half of 19th century his Kelmscott Press produced many of the graphic designs, and created a collector market for this kind of art.  In Oxford he was associated with artists like Morris, Burne-Jones, and  Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Together they formed the Pre-Raphaelites group, which their ideas influenced the modern graphic design considerably.&lt;ref&gt; See: Encarta [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563639/William_Morris.html], and Larousse [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/#larousse/1170/102/Morris] &lt;/ref&gt;

 
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Morris Peacock and Dragon Fabric 1878 v2.jpg|This fabric design called Peacock and Dragon, which is the work of William Morris (1878) is a beautiful example of decorative graphic design. Such designs was revived during the 1960s with the emergence of the hippie movement. 
Image:Morris Tulip and Willow design 1873.jpg| This Morris Tulip and Willow design (1873) is another example of decorative graphics. The powerful diagonal blue, with only some suggestion of orange creates a harmonious color scheme that can be used effectively in the design of a poster or other graphic design media.  
Image:Kelmscott Press - The Nature of Gothic by John Ruskin (first page).jpg|This is the first page of  The Nature of Gothic by John Ruskin which was published by Kelmscott Press of William Morris. The decorative design was the revival of the Gothic style in graphic design.  
Image:Rubaiyat Morris Burne-Jones Manuscript.jpg| This book of Poetry, called Rubaiyat, by the famous Persian poet Omar Khayyam, is an example of early modern graphic design cooperation, with a graphic composition of calligraphy and decorative design by Morris and painting by Burne-Jones.     
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Mondrian's Minimalism Revolution ==
The Dutch painter Piet Mondrian in the years 1920-21 courageously introduced the style of minimalism in painting. His simple geometric compositions, together with the use of only  three basic colors, blue, yellow, and red, in combination with black and white created  
a new venue for the graphic designers. He demonstrated that with simple relocation of these colors, and experiment with the proportionality of various square surfaces one can achieve extremely different ambiances and various feelings. For the graphic designers who intend to convey a message with a minimum interference from the extraneous elements his experiment in minimalism was a valuable gift.

Image:Abe-Rebus French.png|A '''rebus''' ([[Latin]]: &quot;by things&quot;) is a kind of word  puzzle which uses pictures to represent words or parts of words, such as &quot;T,4,2&quot; instead of &quot;tea for two&quot;. The above French rebus says: A big bishop full of appetite have crossed Paris without lunch(Un grand abbé, rempli d'appétit a traversé Paris sans souper);  or, literally: one big AB (un grand AB) full of little &quot;a&quot;s (rempli d'a petits) |a crossed by i (a traversé par i) |100 under p  (100 sous p)  &lt;ref&gt;See: Larousse [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/#larousse/66167/11/r%C3%A9bus], and Encarta  [http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q=r%C3%A9bus]&lt;/ref&gt; Rebus has played an important role in creation of alphabets.  
Image:Armoiries Actuelles Espagne.svg|This is the heraldic sign of the Bourbons of Spain. The heraldic signs exist from ancient times. For example Romans used eagle as their symbol, French used fleur de lis, and Persians used the sign of their god, Ahura Mazda. After the second half of the 12th century these signs  became prominent in the west with the establishment of feudal regimes. Given that the faces of the fully plate-armored knights were hidden these signs were used to identify them. The signs were created under strict rules and traditions. &lt;ref&gt;See: Encarta [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761565530/Heraldry.html]  &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logos and Trade Marks ===

A '''trade mark''', identified by the symbols [[trademark symbol|™]] and [[registered trademark symbol|®]], or '''mark''' is a distinctive sign or indicator used by an individual, company or other entity to identify its products or services and to distinguish them from those of other producers. A trademark is a type of intellectual property, and typically  a name, word, phrase, [[logo]], [[symbol]], design, image, or a combination of these elements.&lt;ref&gt; See: the Random House Unabridged Dictionary, © Random House, Inc. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
   

 
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Coca-Cola logo.svg| This graphic design of the Coca-Cola logo is the work of Frank Mason Robinson who created it in 1885&lt;ref&gt;There is no proof as to who originally wrote it, but master Penman Louis Madarasz(1859-1910) was said to have told one of his students that the work was his. When the work was created Madarasz had a mail-order business and could easily have done it, and the writing style is similar to his. In the book &quot;An Elegant Hand&quot; by William E Henning, it states that Frank Mason Robinson, who was the bookkeeper of the firm oringinated the name Coca-Cola and specified that it be written in Spencerian script. In a 1914 court case, Robinson testified that he was &quot;practically the originator&quot; and that &quot;some engraver here by the name of Frank Ridge was brought into it&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;. This old Logotype  has been around more than a century, which could be regarded as a measure its success.

Image:Google.png| Google is a young high-tech company, and its logotype created by  Ruth Kedar reminds us of the Mondrian minimalism. Kedar has emphasized the playfulness of her design, and its simplicity that conveys an illusion of non-design. According to her &quot; The colors evoke memories of child play, but deftly stray from the color wheel strictures so as to hint to the inherent element of serendipity creeping into any search results page ... The texture and shading of each letter is done in an unobtrusive way resulting in lifting it from the page while giving it both weight and lightness. &lt;ref&gt; Google Logo Design and History, [http://www.dinesh.com/History_of_Logos/Worlds_Best_Brands_and_Logos/Google_Logo_Design_and_History/]   Read Kedar interview here: [http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/01/the-brains-behi.html] &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signs of Culture and Peace ===

&lt;gallery&gt;

== Information Signs: ISOTYPE and the Viennese Method ==
In 1921, Otto Neurath, an Austrian social scientist, introduced graphic design in order to facilitate the understanding of  various social ad economical trends through the creative use of statistical charts. In 1924, Neurath advocated the establishment of the Museum of Economy and Society, an institution for public education and social information. In May 1925, the Museum's first graphical displays was opened to the public. The  exhibition showed various complicated social and economical trends, and by using charts which were intuitive and interesting made those concepts easy to grasp. This style of presentation at the time was called the Viennese method, but now it is known as ISOTYPE charts.  &lt;ref&gt;See : Stroom Den Haag  [http://www.stroom.nl/paginas/pagina.php?pa_id=6422177] .&lt;/ref&gt;

Image:Rowing_pictogram.svg‎| ISOTYPE signs, such as this sign of rowing, help to simultaneously communicate a message to a large number of people who speak different languages. In the absence of such signs in venues such an Olympic village one would have needed many  written signs like: The  Roning،  Rowing، Κωπηλασία، Aviron  and   ボート競技 which not only would have been costly but also may confuse people.

== Dynamic Designs, and Computer Animation ==

&lt;gallery&gt;
   
Image:Muybridge race horse animated.gif‎| Computer animation creates the illusion of motion by viewing a succession of computer-generated still images. In the past, animation was produced by filming painted sequences on plastic or paper cels. The above animation has created from photos by Eadweard Muybridge in 1887. Computer animation can be used to produce special effects for educational purposes, such as study of planetary motions,  particles collisions, or fluid dynamics.   &lt;ref&gt; See:[http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554797/eadweard_muybridge.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Image:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif | Dynamic graphics are used to facilitate understanding of concepts in science, engineering, medicine, education, and business.  Computer graphics facilitates the production of images that range in complexity from simple line drawings to three-dimensional reconstructions of data. The evolution of a phenomenon through time and its interactions with other elements can be shown through animation.&lt;ref&gt;See:[http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568805/Computer_Animation.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Image:Orthographic_camera_distance_focal_length.gif|  In this 3-D dynamic design a cube is studied from various angles. These type of animations can be very useful in study of various objects.  They can also be used to study the evolution of a process through time. &lt;ref&gt;See: The Art of 3-D : Computer Animation and Imaging, 2nd Edition, by Isaac Victor Kerlow , John Wiley &amp; Sons; 2 Sub edition (May 11, 2000), ISBN-10: 047136004X, ISBN-13: 978-0471360049&lt;/ref&gt; :
Image:5-cell.gif‎|The art of dynamic designs is still at its infancy. With the availability of sophisticated computer graphic techniques the horizon has been expanded enormously for the graphic designers. 
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Placards and Posters ==
Placard and posters existed from the ancient times. The Greek ''axons'' and the Roman ''Albums'', with their decorative designs and announcements, were quite similar to today's posters. In ancient Greece the name of athletes, and  games schedules  were written on columns that were slowly turning on an axis. Romans used whitewashed walls in their markets in which sellers, money lenders, and slave traders wrote their announcements and advertised for their products, and to attract the attention of customers they added an attractive design. &lt;ref&gt;See: Larousse [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/#larousse/1441/11/affiche ]&lt;/ref&gt;
With the invention of printing, in 1440, and particularly the development of the lithographic process, invented by a Czech named Alois Senefelder in 1798 in Austria,  creation of poster become feasible. Although handmade  posters existed before, they were mainly used for government announcements. William Caxton, who in 1477 started a printing company in England produced the first printed poster. &lt;ref&gt;See: Encarta [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572424/William_Caxton.html] &lt;/ref&gt;
In 1870, the advertising poster emerged. &lt;ref&gt;In the 19th and 20th century artists like Jules Chéret, Daumier, Manet, Picasso, Ben Shahn, Norman Rockwell,  Alexandre Steinlen, Alphonse Mucha, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec made compelling posters advertising, products entertainments and restaurants. Matt Morgan's circus advertisements (c.1890) started the American poster, and this was followed  by Edward Penfield, Will H. Bradley, Maxfield Parrish, Howard Chandler Christie, James Montgomery Flagg, Charles Dana Gibson, and Harrison Fisher. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See: M. Rickards, The Rise and Fall of the Poster (1971); J. Barnicoat, A Concise History of Posters: 1870–1970 (1972); D. Ades, The Twentieth Century Poster (1984); J. Barnicoat, Posters: A Concise History (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

  
===  Chromolithography and Emergence of Modern Poster  ===

After centuries of black ink on white paper, the invention of chromolithography in the US around 1840 revolutionized the art of poster. Because of its low production costs, over the 50 years after the American Civil War, millions of chromolithographs were printed and were sold for under $10. Louis Prang, a Bostonian, produced fine-art subjects, such as still lifes, landscapes, and classical subjects.&lt;ref&gt; see: Gallo, Max, The Poster in History, (2002) W.W.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless , it was only after Jules Chéret posters,  in 1847, that the potential of this technical process for creation of artistic posters was realized. &lt;ref&gt;See : apanese Posters: The First 100 Years, Richard S. Thornton, Design Issues, Vol. 6, No. 1, Design in Asia and Australia (Autumn, 1989), pp. 4-14&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Jules Chéret ====
&lt;gallery&gt;
 Image:Cheret, Jules - Le Pays des Fees (pl 181).jpg| Chéret's posters elevated advertisement to an art form.In 1858 he printed his first color poster in France. He ultimately became known as &quot;the father of modern lithography&quot;, as well as the &quot;Father of the Poster&quot;. Chéret revolutionized the composition of posters, using the design as the dominant features while reducing text to a minor explanatory role. 

Image:Cheret, Jules - Les Saxoleine.jpg|  Chéret's  style gradually evolved from the complex Victorian decorative graphics into a simpler compositional design in which large central figures were prominent in the motif with simplified backgrounds, and large surfaces of vivid colour. Hand-lettered titles were used in harmony with the design.&lt;ref&gt;نگاه کنید به : History of Modern Design: Graphics and Products Since the Industrial Revolution, By David Raizman, Published by Laurence King Publishing, 2003,ISBN 1856693481,9781856693486, &lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See : The Poster as Art; Jules Cheret and the Struggle for the Equality of the Arts in Late Nineteenth-Century France, by Bradford R. Collins, 1985, The MIT Press.   &lt;/ref&gt;

Image:Cheret, Jules - Carnivale Poster.jpg| His large posters displayed free-spirited women which earned him the title of &quot;father of the women's liberation.&quot;   The women of Chéret's posters, playful, elegant and lively were very different from previously depicted prostitutes or puritans. 
 

Image:Cheret, Jules - Humber Cycles.jpg| Chéret  minimized  the role of the text in a poster. In this poster all of the relevant information is summarized in one short sentence.

==== Louis John Rhead ====
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Louis John Rhead - The Quartier Latin.jpg | Louis John Rhead  was from a family of well-known English artists. He was sent to Paris at the age of thirteen to study under Boulanger, and returned to England several years later. Rhead continued his studies under Edward Pointer and Alphonse Legros.By the time he arrived in America in 1888, he was one of the main leaders in the Art Nouveau movement along with Will Bradley and Edward Penfield. He created posters for Scribner's and Century magazines. &lt;ref&gt;See:The Complete «Masters of the, Poster»: All 256 Color Plates from «les Maîtres de L'affiche», By Stanley Appelbaum, Published by Courier Dover Publications, 1990, ISBN 0486263096, 9780486263090&lt;/ref&gt;.   
Image:Louis John Rhead - Century Magazine.jpg| In the 1890s Rhead designed nearly one hundred posters. His first posters were done in England for Cassell's Magazine and the Weekly Dispatch, and also for Phitesi boots. In the United States he created posters for a variety of magazines, including The Century, St. Nicholas, Harper's, The Bookman, and Scribner's. He also produced large one- and two-sheet posters for the New York Sun and the New York Journal, and commercial posters for the printing firm Louis Prang and Company, as well as for products such as Lundborg perfumes, Pearline washing powders, and Packer's soap.&lt;ref&gt; See: Smithsonian Institution  [http://americanart.si.edu/search/artist_bio.cfm?ID=4020]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Image:Louis Rhead-Morning Journal.jpg|  In 1895 he won a Gold Medal for ''Best American Poster Design'' at the first International Poster Show in Boston. By the late 1890s, the popularity of poster art declined and Rhead turned his skills to book illustration &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Louis Rhead Obituary&quot;, New York Times (July 30th, 1926)&lt;/ref&gt;.  Between 1902 and his death in 1926, Rhead illustrated numerous children books published by Harpers and others.
Image:Louis Rhead-The Sun1.jpg | Rhead was a great graphic designer and his startling use of colors, and sophisticated compositions created art work that looks still modern and vanguard.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Edward Penfield ====
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Aetna dynamite.jpg |Edward Penfield,  has been called the “originator of the poster in America. He was born 2 Jun 1866 in Brooklyn, New York to Ellen Lock Moore and Josiah B. Penfield.   Although he is mostly known for his advertising ‘placards’ for Harper's New Monthly Magazine, it should be noted that his Harpers years constitute less than a third of his thirty-four year career. When he was in his early twenties Edward enrolled at the Art Students’ League in New York City. During the fall of 1889, Edward Penfield attended the costume class, from which several of his pen and ink studies still survive. He also studied painting under the impressionist George de Forest Brush around 1890.
Image:CU Baseball.jpg | An associate art editor at Harper and Brothers who had seen Penfield's work suggested to the head of the art department to hire him as a staff illustrator.Penfield’s first published work appeared in Harper’s Weekly in 1891. In his early works, Penfield executed ink and watercolor wash illustrations in a  similar style to the older generation of graphc artists, such as W.T. Smedley, W.A. Rogers, Thor de Thulstrep, Rufus Zogbaum and E.A. Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;See: Wilczak, Susan A.

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 
Image:Edward Penfield- Harper's Magazine May 1897.jpg |In 1892, Penfield traveled to Europe to further his study in Paris with George de Forest Brush however, soon he was called back by the Harpers to head up their art department. His trademark linework and use of broad tonal areas developed gradually after his return from Europe.  What made his work compelling was his mastery of design as well as illustration. These and other stylistic trademarks emanated from a number of influences, including the compositional precepts and casual poses found in Japanese prints, the hand-craftsmanship of the Arts and Crafts movement, the impressionistic approach of Parisian poster-making, and British poise and directness.&lt;ref&gt;See: Bauwens, Maurice; Hayashi, T.; La Forgue, Jules; Meier-Graefe, J.; Pennell, Joseph; and Boudét, G., editors. Les affiches étrangères illustrées. Paris: G. Boudet, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Image:Tom Sawyer, Detective (novel).jpg | The graphic art of Penfield demonstrates a keen sense of design and composition. The Art Center Bulletin of April 1925 remembered his contribution to illustrative art this way: &quot;To everything he produced Penfield brought his great gifts of design and draftsmanship, a wonderful sincerity that never faltered, and a beautiful humbleness of spirit.&quot; As early as 1894, his work was described by Publisher's Weekly: &quot;The advertising poster has within recent years actually soared into the regions of art.&quot; Penfield is also credited with bringing abstraction to commercial art through his boldly simplified shapes.&lt;ref&gt;See: Exman, Eugene.

===   Toulouse-Lautrec and Renaissance of Graphics in Posters    ===

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec 049.jpg|  Henri Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901) was born as the son of an aristocratic and rich family in the South of France. From early childhood he developed a passion for drawing and painting and received painting and drawing lessons by a professional artist, Rene Princeteau. He went to Paris in 1882 to study painting, where he met Emil Bernard and Vincent van der Gogh. He became attracted to the Impressionist style and joined the movement. Lautrec became a part of the bohemian community of Montmartre with its nightlife of cabarets, cafes, restaurants, sleazy dance halls and brothels. &lt;ref&gt;  ACKROYD, Christopher. Toulouse-Lautrec.

Image:Lautrec ambassadeurs, aristide bruant (poster) 1892.jpg | Toulouse Lautrec, was deeply influenced by Japanese woodblock prints. From the 1850s onwards, Japanese art work flowed into the west and attracted the attention of both artists and collectors. The term &quot;japonisme&quot; was coined in 1872 by Philippe Burty, a French art critic.  Lautrec lived during the height of what have been called &quot;the banquet years&quot; of Paris. Although his handicap and his alcohol abuse kept him from enjoying some of life's pleasures, it was the nightlife of Montmartre which inspired his work. (1892)&lt;ref&gt;SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF ART.

Image:Lautrec reine de joie (poster) 1892.jpg| The ideal, elegant, and joyful women of Jules Chéret were replaced in Lautrec posters by prostitutes and madams who accepted him as a fellow outcast, and permitted him to wander about, sketching and painting freely on his own initiative or on commission to the brothels. He grew close to his prostitute models; he played games with them, brought them presents, and accompanied them to his studio, restaurants, circuses, or theaters during their time off. He neither vilified nor glamorized these women, but presented an objective, almost documentary view of the everyday life they shared with him; (1892)&lt;ref&gt;ADHEMAR, Jean.

== Posters in The First Half of the 20th Century ==

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Unclesamwantyou.jpg| After the First World War the art of poster changed drastically. Posters were used for war propaganda, to encourage young people to enlist in the army, and to sell the government war bonds in order to finance the costs of war. From strictly artistic view these posters were unimaginative and stale, and were very far from the master pieces of the 19th century posters.  &lt;ref&gt;See: [http://afsf.lackland.af.mil/Images/WWII/ World War II Posters]
