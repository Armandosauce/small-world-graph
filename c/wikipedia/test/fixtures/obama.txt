Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is &quot;black enough,&quot; Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the [[National Association of Black Journalists]] that the debate is not about his physical appearance or his record on issues of concern to black voters. Obama said that &quot;we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Les |last=Payne |title=In One Country, a Dual Audience |format=paid archive |date=2007-08-19 |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/1322008241.html?dids=1322008241:1322008241&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT |work=Newsday |accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a December 2006 ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial headlined &quot;The Man from Nowhere,&quot; [[Peggy Noonan]], advised &quot;[[The Establishment|establishment]]&quot; commentators to avoid becoming too quickly excited about Obama's still early political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peggy |last=Noonan |title=The Man From Nowhere|date=2006-12-15 |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110009388 |work=OpinionJournal (Wall Street Journal) |accessdate=2008-04-07}} See also: Obama (2006), pp. 122–124.

Kennedy]], Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: &quot;I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Dorning |title=Obama Reaches Across Decades to JFK |format=paid archive |date=2007-10-04 |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/1353513781.html?dids=1353513781:1353513781&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+4%2C+2007&amp;author=Mike+Dorning |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=2008-04-07}} See also: {{cite news |first=Toby |last=Harnden |title=Barack Obama is JFK Heir, Says Kennedy Aide |date=2007-10-15 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/10/12/wobama112.xml |work=Daily Telegraph |accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, [[Global Language Monitor]] added &quot;Obama&quot; to its English lexicon based on the use of Obama- as a root for [[neologism]]s such as: obamamentum, obamaBot, obamacize, obamarama, obamaNation, obamanomics, obamican, obamafy, obamamania, and obamacam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/obamaspeak |title=ObamaSpeak:‘Obama’ as a Word Enters English Language |publisher=Global Language Monitor |date=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/offbeat/2008/02/19/moos.obamafied.cnn |title=Are you 'Obamafied'? | type=video |publisher=CNN |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
