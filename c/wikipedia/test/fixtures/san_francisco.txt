}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many tourists refer to San Francisco as &quot;Frisco&quot;, a name popularized through songs like [[Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay]] and [[Sweet Little Sixteen]]. However, locals discourage this use and prefer the nickname ''The City by the Bay.'' Samuel D. Cohen writes that many credit &quot;Friscophobia&quot; to newspaper columnist [[Herb Caen]], whose first book, published in 1953, was &quot;Don't Call it Frisco.&quot; Caen was considered by many to be the recognized authority on what was, and what was not, beneath the city's dignity, and to him, Frisco was intolerable. {{cite web | last =Cohen | first =Sam | title = Locals Know best: only tourists call it 'Frisco'| work = Golden Gater Online| publisher = San Francisco State University | date = [[1997-09-11]]| url =http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/gater/fall97/sept11/Frisco.html | accessdate = 2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City That Knows How (archaic),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1776, the Spanish [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|settled]] the tip of the peninsula, establishing a [[Presidio of San Francisco|fort]] at the Golden Gate and a [[Mission San Francisco de Asís|mission]] named for [[Francis of Assisi]]. The [[California Gold Rush]] in 1848 propelled the city into a period of rapid growth, transforming it into the largest city on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] at the time. After being devastated by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake and fire]], San Francisco was quickly rebuilt, hosting the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] nine years later. During [[World War II]], San Francisco was the send-off point for many soldiers to the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]]. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, massive immigration, liberalizing attitudes, and other factors gave rise to the [[Summer of Love]] and the [[gay rights movement]], cementing San Francisco as a liberal bastion in the United States.

San Francisco is a popular international tourist destination famous for its landmarks, including the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], [[Alcatraz Island]], the [[San Francisco cable car system|cable car]]s, [[Coit Tower]], and [[Chinatown, San Francisco, California|Chinatown]], its steep rolling hills, and its eclectic mix of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[modern architecture]]. The city is also known for its diverse, cosmopolitan population, including large and long-established [[Asian American]], and [[LGBT]] communities.

[[Image:SanFrancisco1851a.jpg|thumb|right|1851 San Francisco]]Entrepreneurs sought to capitalize on the wealth generated by the Gold Rush. Early winners were the banking industry, which saw the founding of [[Wells Fargo]] in 1852, and the railroad industry, as the magnates of [[the Big Four]], led by [[Leland Stanford]], collaborated in the building of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The development of the [[Port of San Francisco]] established the city as a center of trade. Catering to the needs and tastes of the growing population, [[Levi Strauss]] opened a dry goods business and [[Domingo Ghirardelli]] began manufacturing chocolate. Immigrant laborers made the city a polyglot culture, with [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] railroad workers creating the city's [[Chinatown, San Francisco, California|Chinatown]] quarter. The first [[San Francisco cable car system|cable cars]] carried San Franciscans up [[Clay Street Hill Railroad|Clay Street]] in 1873. The city's sea of [[Victorian house]]s began to take shape, and civic leaders campaigned for a spacious public park, resulting in plans for [[Golden Gate Park]]. San Franciscans built schools, churches, theaters, and all the hallmarks of civic life.

It was in this period that the island of [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]], a former [[military]] stockade, began its service as a federal maximum security prison, housing notorious inmates such as [[Al Capone]]. San Francisco later celebrated its regained grandeur with a [[Expo (exhibition)|World's Fair]], the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in 1939–40, creating [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island]] in the middle of the bay to house it.

San Francisco is located on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] of the U.S. at the tip of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] and includes significant stretches of the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[San Francisco Bay]] within its boundaries. Several [[islands of San Francisco Bay|islands]] are part of the city, notably [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]], [[Treasure Island, California|Treasure Island]], and the adjacent [[Yerba Buena Island]], together with small portions of [[Alameda, California|Alameda Island]], [[Angel Island, California|Angel Island]], and [[Red Rock Island]]. Also included are the uninhabited [[Farallon Islands]], 27 miles (43&amp;nbsp;km) offshore in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The mainland within the city limits roughly forms a &quot;seven-by-seven-mile square,&quot; a common local colloquialism referring to the city's shape.

San Francisco is famous for [[List of San Francisco, California Hills|its hills]].

The [[San Andreas Fault|San Andreas]] and [[Hayward Fault]]s are responsible for much [[earthquake]] activity, even though neither passes through the city itself. It was the San Andreas Fault which slipped and caused the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989. Minor earthquakes occur on a regular basis. The threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the city's infrastructure development. The city has repeatedly upgraded its building codes, requiring retrofits for older buildings and higher engineering standards for new construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Smith |title=What San Francisco didn't learn from the '06 quake |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/04/15/HOGQ9I7P2T1.DTL |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2006-04-15 |accessdate=2008-06-30 }} &lt;/ref&gt; However, there are still thousands of smaller buildings that remain vulnerable to quake damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Selna |title=S.F. leaders ignore weak buildings' quake risk |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2008/06/29/MNDD110U2E.DTL |page= A-1 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2008-06-29|accessdate=2008-06-30 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of cold ocean water and the high heat of the California mainland create the city's characteristic [[fog]] that can cover the western half of the city all day during the spring and early summer. The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods, in the late summer, and during the fall, which are the warmest months of the year. Due to its sharp topography and maritime influences, San Francisco exhibits a multitude of distinct [[microclimate]]s. The high hills in the geographic center of the city are responsible for a 20 percent variance in annual rainfall between different parts of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFClimate&quot;/&gt; They also protect neighborhoods directly to their east from the foggy and cool conditions experienced in the [[Sunset District, San Francisco, California|Sunset District]]; for those who live on the eastern side of the city, San Francisco is sunnier, with an average of 260 clear days, and only 105 cloudy days per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Under the city charter, the government of San Francisco is constituted of two co-equal branches. The executive branch is headed by the mayor and includes other citywide elected and appointed officials as well as the civil service. The 11-member Board of Supervisors, the legislative branch, is headed by a president and is responsible for passing laws and budgets, though San Franciscans also make use of [[Initiative|direct ballot initiatives]] to pass legislation.

Because of its unique city-county status, local government exercises jurisdiction over property that would otherwise be located outside of its corporation limit. [[San Francisco International Airport]], though ostensibly located in [[San Mateo County]], is legally in San Francisco because it is owned and operated by the City and County of San Francisco. San Francisco was also granted a perpetual leasehold over the [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]] and [[drainage basin|watershed]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] by the [[Raker Act]] in 1913.&lt;ref name=&quot;CityCounty&quot;/&gt;

In 2006, the Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance making San Francisco the first city in the nation to provide health care services to all uninsured residents, with creation of the [[Healthy San Francisco]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This trend continued following the 1989 [[Loma Prieta Earthquake]], when city leaders decided to demolish the [[Embarcadero Freeway]], and voters approved demolition of a portion of the [[Central Freeway]], converting them into street-level boulevards.&lt;ref name=&quot;freeway&quot;/&gt;

[[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]] begins at the approach to the [[San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] and is the only direct automobile link to the East Bay. [[U.S. Highway 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] extends Interstate 80 to the south along the San Francisco Bay toward [[Silicon Valley]]. Northbound, 101 uses arterial streets [[Van Ness Avenue (San Francisco)|Van Ness Avenue]] and [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]] to the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], the only direct road access from San Francisco to [[Marin County]] and points north. [[California State Route 1|Highway 1]] also enters San Francisco at the Golden Gate Bridge, but diverts away from 101, bisecting the west side of the city as the [[19th Avenue (San Francisco)|19th Avenue]] arterial thoroughfare, and joining with [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]] at the city's southern border. Interstate 280 continues this route along the central portion of the Peninsula south to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Northbound, 280 turns north and east and terminates in the South of Market area. [[California State Route 35|Highway 35]], which traverses the majority of the Peninsula along the ridge of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], enters the city from the south as [[Skyline Boulevard]], following city streets until it terminates at its intersection with Highway 1. Major east&amp;ndash;west thoroughfares include [[Geary Boulevard]], the [[List of streets in San Francisco|Lincoln Way]]/[[List of streets in San Francisco|Fell Street]] corridor, and [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]]/[[List of streets in San Francisco|Portola Drive]].

The city-owned system operates both a combined light rail/subway system (the [[Muni Metro]]) and a bus network that includes [[trolleybus]]es, standard diesel motorcoaches and diesel hybrid buses.

Commuter rail is provided by two complementary agencies. [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART) is the regional rapid transit system which connects San Francisco with the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] through the [[Transbay Tube]]. The line runs under Market Street to Civic Center, where it turns south to the Mission District, the southern part of the city, and through northern [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]], to the [[San Francisco International Airport]], and [[Millbrae, California|Millbrae]].&lt;ref name=&quot;transportation&quot;/&gt; The [[Caltrain]] rail system runs from San Francisco along the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] down to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].&lt;ref name=&quot;transportation&quot;/&gt; The line dates from 1863, and for many years was operated by [[Southern Pacific]].

The [[Transbay Terminal]] serves as the terminus for long-range bus service (such as [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]]) and as a hub for regional bus systems [[AC Transit]] ([[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]]), [[SamTrans]] ([[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]]), and [[Golden Gate Transit]] (Marin and [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma Counties]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.transbaycenter.org/TransBay/content.aspx?id=36 |title= Project Overview - Regional Transit |accessdate= 2008-06-08 |publisher= Transbay Transit Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amtrak]] also runs a shuttle bus from San Francisco to its [[Emeryville (Amtrak station)|rail station]] in [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Station/Station_Page&amp;code=EMY |title= Profile of Emeryville Station |accessdate= 2008-06-08 |publisher= Amtrak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small fleet of commuter and tourist [[ferries]] operate from the [[Ferry Building]] and [[Pier 39]] to points in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], and north to [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] in [[Solano County, California|Solano County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;transportation&quot;/&gt;

[[San Francisco International Airport]] (SFO), though located 13 miles (21 km) south of the city in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]], is under the jurisdiction of the City and County of San Francisco.

During the economic boom of the late 1990s, when traffic saturation led to frequent delays, it became difficult to respond to calls to relieve the pressure by constructing an additional runway as that would have required additional landfill. Such calls subsided in the early 2000s as traffic declined, and, in 2006, SFO was the 14th busiest airport in the U.S. and 26th busiest in the world, handling 33.5 million passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;23rd&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:FerryBuildingEmbarcaderoBayBridge.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Ferry Building]] along the [[The Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]]]]
{{main|Port of San Francisco}}
The [[Port of San Francisco]] was once the largest and busiest seaport on the West Coast. It featured rows of [[piers]] perpendicular to the shore, where cargo from the moored ships was handled by cranes and manual labor and transported to nearby warehouses. The port handled cargo to and from trans-Pacific and Atlantic destinations, and was the West Coast center of the [[West coast lumber trade|lumber trade]]. The [[1934 West Coast Longshore Strike]], an important episode in the history of the [[Labor unions in the United States|American labor movement]], brought the port to a standstill. The advent of [[container shipping]] made pier-based ports obsolete, and most commercial berths moved to the [[Port of Oakland]].

Many piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the [[Embarcadero Freeway]] reopened the downtown waterfront, allowing for redevelopment. The centerpiece of the port, the [[Ferry Building]], while still receiving commuter ferry traffic, has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace. The port's other activities now focus on developing waterside assets to support recreation and tourism.
