'''Victoria Lanz''' (born [[March 22]], [[1981]]) is the first [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] [[pornographic actress]] to gain international recognition. 

Lanz's career began with a trip to [[Spain]] where she and her husband/manager, Johnny Montoya, did a [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]] tape for independent [[pornography|porn]] [[Film director|director]] Giancarlo Candiano. In subsequent years, Lanz would work on several projects with Candiano. 

Three months after that audition, she was nominated at the [[Barcelona International Erotic Film Festival]] (FICEB) in 2005, as Best Spanish Supporting Actress for her role in the film ''Las Esclavas de Sirius'', directed by Jesús YK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ficeb.com/notas_prensa/Listado%20premiados.pdf | title=LISTADO DE PELÍCULAS PREMIADAS PARA LA XIII EDICIÓN DEL FESTIVAL INTERNACIONAL DE CINE ERÓTICO DE BARCELONA | accessdate=2007-06-19 | author=Neus Purtí | coauthors=Marc Gall, Marta Llimona | date=2005-10-10 | format=PDF |publisher=[http://www.ficeb.com/ FICEB] | pages=6 | language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

So far Lanz is the only Venezuelan porn actress to be involved in the [[sex industry]] at a high level. She has worked with several major and important studios, such as [[Private Media Group]], [[Zero Tolerance Entertainment]], and [[Evil Angel (studio)|Evil Angel]].

Lanz's movies are mostly of the [[Gonzo pornography|gonzo]] sub-genre, but she has also worked in some important features (especially in [[Europe]]). In an interview, she said that the kind of films she is &quot;...always interested [in] are those with production values and nothing that includes extreme acts of humiliation, bondage, bestiality, etc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.el-nacional.com/www/site/detalle_noticia.php?q=nodo/18945 | title=Actriz porno venezolana revela su lado pudoroso Victoria Lanz, la actriz porno venezolana más famosa del planeta, desnuda su vida personal en Todo en Domingo | accessdate=2008-03-29 | author=Carla Candia Casado |date= March 2008 |publisher=[http://www.el-nacional.com/www/site/detalle_noticia.php?q=nodo/18945] | pages=1 | language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot; Most of her [[filmography]] is [[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]], featuring such acts as [[anal sex]] and [[double penetration]]. 

== Venezuelan porn ==

While she is the first Venezuelan porn actress to gain international recognition, Victoria Lanz is not the first Venezuelan porn actress. Prior to Lanz's arrival on the scene, there have been others, including [[Angelina Valentine]], [[Brianna Devil]], and [[Allison Miller (pornstar)|Allison Miller]]. Lanz is the first of them to use her Venezuelan origin as a &quot;trademark&quot;. The Venezuelan porn has always been some kind of urban legend because its status has always been kind of underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.exceso.net//detalle.php?id=88 | title=Pabellón porno | accessdate=2008-03-19 | author=Manuel Gerardo Sánchez | date=2008-03-03 |publisher=[http://www.exceso.net/ Exceso] | pages=1 | language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this situation several adult film companies have filmed movies in Venezuelan territory with Venezuelan actresses. However with the appearance of Lanz this might be changing in the near future; proof of that is the uprising interest in the conventional Venezuelan media for the pornographic expression besides the appearance of publications with a notable erotic inclination such as a Venezuelan version of [[Playboy Magazine]] as well as other magazines such as: Urbe Bikini, Sensual Latina and Líbido.

Movie poster for the [[2007 in film|2007 film]] ''[[Primeval (film)|Primeval]]''.

== Fair use rationale for [[Primeval (film)|Primeval]] ==
#For an article about a film, the original poster is arguably one of the most important images that could be included. 
#No free or public domain images have been located for this film. 
#The image is of lower resolution than the original poster (copies made from it will be of inferior quality). 
#The poster is to suggest something of the film's genre and style.
#The poster is being used for informational purposes only, and its use is not believed to detract from the original film in any way. 
#The poster is used on various websites, and its use on Wikipedia does not make it significantly more accessible than it already is. 
#The poster's use on Wikipedia is entirely encyclopedic in nature.
